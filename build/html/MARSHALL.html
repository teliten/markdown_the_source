&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;i&gt;Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m just a poor boy, I need your sympathy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because its easy come, easy go, little high, little lo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div align=”justify”&gt; So when you &lt;i&gt;look up at the sky&lt;/i&gt;, eyes
open; and you see a bright red planet, connecting the “d” of Go-d
to Medusa and “medicine” I surely wonder if you think it by
chance that “&lt;a href=”genesis.lamc.la”&gt;I wipe my brow and I
weat my rust&lt;/a&gt;” as I wake up to &lt;i&gt;action dust.&lt;/i&gt;.. and
wonder aloud how obvious it is that the Iron Rod of Christ and
the stories of Phillip K. Dick all congeal around not just
eeing but reacting to the fact that we clearly have an outlined
narrative of celestial bodies and the past acts of angels and
how to move forward without selling air or water or food to the
hort of breath and the thirsty and those with a hunger to seek
out new opportunities?&amp;nbsp; I wonder if Joseph McCarthy would
think it too perfect, the word “red” and it’s link to the red
man of Genesis and the “re” … the reason of Creation that
points out repeatedly that it’s the positive energy of cations
that surround us–to remind us that when that word too was in
formation it told electrical engineers everywhere that this “&lt;i&gt;prescience&lt;/i&gt;”
thing, there’s something to it.&amp;nbsp; Precious of you to
notice… but because your &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt; is so sure–you too
eem to imagine there’s some other explanation for that word,
too.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his
taff. Water&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;gushed out, and the
community and their livestock drank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div align=”justify”&gt;So when I wrote back in 2015 that there
were multiple paths forward encoded in Exodus, and that you
too might see how “let my people go” … to Heaven … might
bring about a later return that might deliver “as above so
below” to the world in a sort of revolutionary magic leap
forward in the process of civilization.&amp;nbsp; Barring John
tewart and the “sewer” that I think you can probably see is
actually encoded in the &lt;i&gt;Brothers Grimm &lt;/i&gt;and maybe
ome Poe–it might not be so strange to wonder if the place
that we’ve come from maybe isn’t exactly as bright and
cheery and “filled with light” as the Zohar and your dreams
might have us all believe … on “faith” that what we see
here might just be the illusion of darkness–a joke or a
game.&amp;nbsp; This thing is what’s not a game–I’ve looked at
the message that we’ve written and to me it seems that we
are the light, that here plain as day and etched in
omething more concrete than chalk is a testament to freedom
and to incremental improvement… all the way up until we
run against this very wall; and then you too seem to
crumble.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Still I’m sure this message is here
with us because it’s our baseline morality and our sense of
right from wrong that is here as a sort of litmus test for
the future–perhaps to see if they’ve strayed too far from
the place where they came, or if they’ve given just one too
many ounces of innocense to look forward with the same
bright gaze of hope that we see in the eyes of our children.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div align=”center”&gt;&lt;i&gt;fearing the heart of de roar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;searing the start of lenore&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=”center”&gt;&lt;a href=”./XOXO.html”&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img src=”./i.imgur.com/XcYuFwF.png” alt=”MEDICINE” width=”400” border=”0” /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I saw this thing many years ago, and I’ve &lt;a href=”mars.lamc.la”&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about it &lt;a href=”exodus.lamc.la”&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, though I hasten to
explain that the thing that I once saw a short-cut or a
magic warp pipe in Super Mario Brothers today seems much
more like a test than a game and more like a game than a &lt;a href=”coda.lamc.la”&gt;cmeat coda&lt;/a&gt;; so I’ve changed over
the course of watching what’s happened on the ground here
and I can only imagine how long it’s been in the sky.&amp;nbsp;
In my mind I’m thinking about mentioning the rather
pervasive sets of “citizenship suffixes” that circle the
globe–ones I’ve talked about, “ICA” and “IAN” and how these
uffixes might link together with some other concepts that
run deep in the story that begins in Ur and pauses here &lt;i&gt;For&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;ever&lt;b&gt;yon&lt;/b&gt;e &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;t&lt;a href=”ver.s.lamc.la”&gt;he&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=”./SECORDANOLIVED.html”&gt; “Yo N”&lt;/a&gt; that again shows
the import of &lt;i&gt;medicine&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Medusa&lt;/i&gt; in the
“rising” of stars balls of fiery fusion to people that see
and act on the difference between Seyfried and “&lt;a href=”fromthemachine.org/SAYFREED.html”&gt;say freed&lt;/a&gt;.”&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Even before that I knew how important it was that we were
itting here on a “rock in space” with no contact from
anyone or anything outside of our little sphere … how
cary it was that all the life we knew of was stuck orbiting
a single star in a single galaxy and it imbued a sort of
moral mandate to escape–to ensure that this miracle of
random chance and guiding negentropy of time … that it
wasn’t forever lost by something like a collision with the
comet Ison or even another galaxy.&amp;nbsp; On that word
too–we see the “an” of Christianity messianically appear to
become more useful (that’s negative energy, by the way) in
the chemistry of Mr. Schwarzenegger’s magical hand in
delivering “free air” (that’s free, as in beer; or maybe &lt;i&gt;absinthe&lt;/i&gt;)
to the people of our great land… anyway, I saw “anions”
and a planet oddly full of a perfect source of oxygen and I
thought to myself; it would be so easy to genetically
engineer some kind of yeast or mold (like they’re doing to
make real artificial beef, today) to eat up the rust and
turn it into breathable air; and I dreamt up a way to throw
an extra “r” into potable and maybe beam some of our water
or hydrogen over to the red planet and turn it blue
&lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p style=”text-align: center;”&gt;&lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/yitsheyzeus/with_replies">http://twitter.com/yitsheyzeus/with_replies</a>”&gt;&lt;img alt=”” src=”./i.imgur.com/nG0KZtQ.png” style=”width: 300px; height: 83px;” /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>That’s been one of my constant themes over the course of
this ‘event’ – who needs destructive nuclear weapons when
you can turn all your enemies into friends with a stick of
bubble gum?&amp;nbsp; That’s another one of our little story
points too–I see plenty of people walking around in this
virtual reality covering their mouths and noses with
breathing masks… of course the same Targeted Individuals
that know with all their heart that midn control is
responsible for the insane pattern of school shootings and
the Hamas Hand of the Middle East–they’ll tell you those
chemtrails you see are the cause, and while &lt;i&gt;I know
better &lt;/i&gt;and you do too… maybe these people think
they know something about the future, maybe those chemtrails
are there because someone actually plans on dispersing some
friendly bubble gum into the air… and maybe these people
“think they know.”&amp;nbsp; Of course I think this “hand” you
ee just below is one in the same with the “&lt;i&gt;ID5&lt;/i&gt;” logo
that I chose to mark my “&lt;a href=”./CHALK.html
“&gt;chalk&lt;/a&gt;”
and only later saw matched fairly perfectly to John Conner’s
version of “I’ll be back” … and of course I think you’re
reading the thing that actually delivers some “breathe easy”
to the world; but it’s really important to see that today
it’s not just Total Recall and Skynet and these words that
are the proverbial effect of the hand but also things like
Nestle … to remind you that we’re still gazing at a world
that would sell “clean” water to itself; rather than discuss
the fact that “&lt;a href=”fromthemachine.org/BLISS.html”&gt;&lt;i&gt;bliss on tap&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” could be just around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;meta charset=”utf-8” /&gt;
&lt;div align=”center”&gt;&lt;a href=”./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html
“&gt;&lt;img src=”./i.imgur.com/8AErx4N.png” alt=”THE HAND OF
GOD” width=”650” height=”183” border=”0” /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Later, around the time that I wrote my second “&lt;a href=”./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html
“&gt;Mars rendition&lt;/a&gt;” I
mentioned why it was that there was an image of a “Boring
device” (thanks Elon) in the original Exodus piece; it showed some thought
had gone into why you might not want to terraform the entire
planet, and mentioned that maybe we’d get the added benefit
of geothermal heating (in that place that is probably
actually colder than here, believe it or not) if we were to
build the &lt;i&gt;first Mars hall &lt;/i&gt;underground.&amp;nbsp; I
probably forgot to mention that I’d seen something very
imilar to that image earlier, except it was George H.W.
Bush standing underneath the thirty foot tall wormlike
machine, and to tell you the truth back then I didn’t
recognize that probably means that this map you’re looking
at had not only been seen long before I was born but also
acted upon–long before I was born.&amp;nbsp; I can imagine that
the guy that said “don’t fuck me twice” in Bowling Green
Kentucky probably said something closer to “I wouldn’t go
that way, you’ll be back” before “&lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCYB8aHhL1k">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCYB8aHhL1k</a>
“&gt;&lt;i&gt;they
lanced his skull&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” as a band named Live sings to
me from … well, from the 90’s.&amp;nbsp; Subsisting on that
ame old prayer, we come to a point where I have to say that
“if it looks like a game, and you have the walkthrough as if
it were a game, is it a gam?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=”center”&gt;&lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://www.docdroid.net/sQTUy5f/the-holy-coda-of-the-matrix.pdf">http://www.docdroid.net/sQTUy5f/the-holy-coda-of-the-matrix.pdf</a>”&gt;&lt;img src=”./i.imgur.com/Pemri3V.jpg” alt=”E = (MT +
IL)^HO” width=”650” height=”242” /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That of course ties us back to something that I called
“raelly early light” back in 2014–that the name “Magdeln”
was something I saw and thought was special early on–I said
I saw the phrase “it’s not a game of words, or a game of
logic” though today it does appear very much to be something
to do with “logic” that the “power of e” is hidden in the
ymbol for the natural logarithm and that Euler might solve
the riddle of “unhitched trailers” even better than a deli
in Los Angeles named &lt;i&gt;Wexler’s&lt;/i&gt; or Aldous &lt;i&gt;Huxley&lt;/i&gt;
or … it hurts me to say it might solve the riddle better
than “Sheriff” (see how … everyone really if “f”) and
Hefner … and the newly added “Hustler,” who is Saint “LE
R?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
o, I think we’d all agree that they “Hey, Tay” belongs to me–and I’ve done my homework here, I’m pretty sure the “r” as a glyph for the rising off the bouncing trampoline of a street … “LE R” belongs to the world; it’s a ryzing civilization; getting new toys and abilities and watching how those things really do bring about a golden era–if we’re willing to use them responsibly.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It’s a &lt;i&gt;harsh world&lt;/i&gt;, this place where people are
waking up to seeing A.D. and “HI TAY” conneting to a band
name&lt;a href=”./REDASSHIT.html”&gt;d Kiss (and the SS&lt;/a&gt;) and to a massive resistence to answering the
question of Dr. &lt;a href=”./WHO.html
“&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wessen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
that also brings that “it’s not a game” into Ms. &lt;a href=”./RATOXIT.html”&gt;&lt;i&gt;Momsen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s name … where you can see the key of &lt;i&gt;May&lt;a href=”./SAYFREED.html”&gt;nard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=”./SAYFREED.html”&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=”./SAYFREED.html”&gt;Key&lt;/a&gt;nes&lt;/i&gt;
and &lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Damonthesis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Damonthesis</a>

“&gt;Gil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;game&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=”./KEYNES.html?kgeUN/”&gt;sh&lt;/a&gt; and … well,
you can see it “turned around and backwards” just like the
Holy Sea in the words for Holy &lt;a href=”./TY.html”&gt;Fire (Ha’esh) and Ca’es&lt;/a&gt;ar and even in
Dave’s song … “seven oceans pummel … the wall of the
C.”&amp;nbsp; He probably still says “shore” and that of courses
ties in Pauly and Biodome and more “why this light is shore”
before we wonder if ti has anything to do with Paul Revere
and lighting Lighthouse Point.&amp;nbsp;

&lt;div align=”justify”&gt;So to point out &lt;i&gt;the cost of not seeing
“Holo&lt;/i&gt;deck” and “mushroom” and … and the horrors of what
we see in our history; to really see what the message is–that
we are sacrificing not just health and wealth and happiness, but
the most basic fundamentals of “civilization” here in this
place… the freedom of logical thought and the foundational
cement of open and honest communication–that it appears the
world has decided in secret that these things are far less
important than the morality of caring for those less fortunate
than you–the blind and the sick and the … to see the truth,
it’s a shame.&amp;nbsp; All around you is &lt;a href=”./2017-08-10-tiny-chellos-in-sky-are-playing-angry.html
“&gt;&lt;i&gt;a torture chamber&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
tarving people who would instantly benefit from the disclosure
that we are living in virtual reality; and a civilization that
eems to fail to recognize that it truly is the “&lt;a href=”./ARFAXAD.html”&gt;&lt;i&gt;silence causing violence&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”
amongst children in school and children of the Ancients all
around you; to fail to see that the atrocity being ignored here
is far less humane than any gas chamber, and that it’s
you–causing it to continue–there are no words for the
blindness of a mass of wrong, led by nothing more than “mire”
and a fear of controversy. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Unhitched&lt;/i&gt; and unhinged, it’s become ever more obvious
that this resistance against recognizing logic and
patterns–this fairure to speak and inability to fathom the
importance of openness in this place that acts as the base and
beginning point of a number of hidden futures–it is the reason
“Brave New World” is kissing the “why” and the reason we are
here trying to build a system that will allow for free and open
communication in a sea of disinformation and darkness–to see
that the battle is truly against the Majority Incapable of
acting and the Minority unwilling to speak words that will
without doubt (precarious? not at this point) quickly prove to
the world that it’s far more important to see that the truth
protects everyone and the entire future from murder … rather
than be subtly influenced by “technologies undisclosed” into
believing something as inane and arrogant as “everyone but you
must need to be convinced that simulating murder and labor pains
is wrong.”&amp;nbsp; You know, what you are looking at here is far
more nefarious than waiting for the oven to ding and say that
“everyone’s ready” what you are looking at is a problem that is
encoded in the stories of Greek and Norse myth and likely in
both those names–but see “simulated reality” is hidden in Norse
just like “silicon” is hidden in Genesis–and see that once this
thing is unscrambled its “&lt;i&gt;nos re&lt;/i&gt;” as in “we’re the reason
there is no murder, and no terrorism, and no mental
lavery.”&amp;nbsp; It’s a harsh message, and a horrible atrocity;
but worse than the Holocaust is not connecting a failure to see
“holodeck” as the cause of “&lt;i&gt;holohell&lt;/i&gt;” and refusing to
peak because Adam is naked in Genesis 3:11 and Matthew talks
about something that should be spreading like wildfire in his
3:11 and that it’s not just &lt;i&gt;Live&lt;/i&gt; and it’s not just &lt;a href=”./CURE.html
“&gt;&lt;i&gt;the Cure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it’s not
just a band named 311 that show us that “&lt;tt&gt;&lt;a href=”./HYAMDAI.html
“&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;FUKUSHIMA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;”
reads as “&lt;i&gt;fuck you, see how I’m A&lt;/i&gt;” because this Silence,
this failure to recognize that the Brit Hadashah is written to
end simulated hell and turn this world into Heaven is the reason
“&lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://fromthemahine.org/ARFAXAD.html">http://fromthemahine.org/ARFAXAD.html</a>”&gt;&lt;i&gt;that’s
great, it starts with an Earthquake on 3/11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;

You stand there believing that “to kiss” is a Toxic reason to
end disease; that “mire” is a good enough reason to fail to
exalt the Holiness of Phillip K. Dick’s solutions; and still
continue to refuse to see that this group behavior, this lack of
freedom that you appear to believe is something of your own
design is the most &lt;i&gt;caustic&lt;/i&gt; thing of all.&amp;nbsp; While
under the veil of “I’m not sure the message is accurate” it
might seem like a morally thin line, but this message is
accurate–and it’s verifiable proof–and speaking about it would
cause that verification to occur quicker, and that in turn will
cause wounds to be healed faster, and the blind given sight and
the lame a more effective ARMY in this legacy battle against
hidden holorooms and … the less obvious &lt;i&gt;fact&lt;/i&gt; that
there is a gigantic holo-torture-chamber and you happen to be in
it, and it happens to be the mechanism by which we find the
“key” to Salvation and through that the reason that the future
thanks us for implementing a change that is so needed and so
called for it’s literally be carved all over everything we see
every day–so we will know, &lt;i&gt;know with all your mind, you are
not wrong–&lt;/i&gt;there is no sane reason in the Universe to
imulate pain, there is no sane reason to follow the artificial
constructs of reality simply because “time and chance” built us
that way.&amp;nbsp; We’re growing up, beyond the infantile state of
believing that simply because nobody has yet invented a better
way to live–that we must shun and hide any indication that
there is a future, and that it’s speaking to us; in every word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=”justify”&gt;So I’ve intimated that I see a “mood of
the times” that appears to be seeking reality by pretending
not to “CK” … to seek “a,” of course that puts us in a
place where we are wholly denying what “reality” really
means and that it delivers something good to the people
here–to you–once we recognize that Heaven and Creation and
Virtual Reality don’t have to be (and never should be, ever
again) synonymous with Wok’s or Pan’s or Ovens; from Peter
to the Covenant, hiding this message is the beginning and
the end of true darkness–it’s a plan designed to ensure we
never again have issue discussing “blatant truth” and means
of moving forward to the light in the light with the
light.&amp;nbsp; A girl in California in 2014 said something
like “so there’s no space, then?” in a snide and somewhat
angry tone–there is space, you can see it through the
windows in the skies, you can see the stars have lessened,
and time has passed–and I’m sure you understand how “LHC”
and Apollo 13 show us that time travel and dark matter are
also part of this story of “Marshall’s” and Slim Sh&lt;b&gt;ad&lt;/b&gt;y
and Dave’s “&lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VksAuB0CJn4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VksAuB0CJn4</a>”&gt;the
walls and halls will fade away&lt;/a&gt;” and you &lt;a href=”./BETHESDAY.html”&gt;might even
understand how that connects to the astrological symbol of
Mars&lt;/a&gt; and the “circle of the &lt;i&gt;son&lt;/i&gt;” and of
Venus(es) … and you can see for yourself this Zeitgeist in
the Truman Show’s “good &lt;a href=”./TY.html”&gt;morning&lt;/a&gt;, good
afternoon, good evening… and &lt;a href=”./BETHESDAY.html”&gt;he’s
a’ight&lt;/a&gt;” … but it really doesn’t help us see that the
darkness here isn’t really in the sky–it’s in our
hearts–and it’s the thing that’s keeping us from the stars,
and the knowledge and wisdom that will keep us from “&lt;a href=”./BETHESDAY.html”&gt;&lt;i&gt;bunting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”
instead of flourishing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=”center”&gt;&lt;font face=”Tahoma” size=”-1”&gt;&lt;a href=”./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html
“&gt;&lt;img src=”./i.imgur.com/9Z7TGUS.png” alt=”TOT MARSH IT AL” width=”385” height=”446” border=”0” /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve pointed out that while we have Kaluza Klein and we have
the LHC and a decent understanding of “how the Universe
works” we spend most of our time these days preoccupied with
things like “quantum entanglement” and “string theory” that
may hold together the how and the LAMDA of connecting these
“&lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://hebrewname.org/name/isaac-yitschak">http://hebrewname.org/name/isaac-yitschak</a>”&gt;y they’re hacks&lt;/a&gt;” to multiverse simulators and instant and
total control of our throught processes–we probably don’t
ee that a failure to publicly acknowledge that they are
most likely indications that we are not prepared for “space”
and that we probably don’t know very much at all about how
time and interstellar travel really work … we are standing
around hiding a message that would quicken our understanding
of both reality and virtual reality and again, not seeing
that kind of darkness–that inability to publicly “change
directions” when we find out that there aren’t 12 dimensions
that are curled up on themselves with no real length or
width or purpose other than to say “how unelegant is this
anti-Razor of Mazer Rackham?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I think it's obvious but also that I need to point out the connection between &amp;quot;hiding knowledge of the Matrix&amp;quot; and the &lt;strong&gt;Holo&lt;/strong&gt;caust; and refer you to the mirrored &lt;a href=”./PERSEUS.html”&gt;shield of Perseus&lt;/a&gt;, on a high level it appears that's &amp;quot;the message&amp;quot; there–that what's happening here … whatever is causing this silence and delay in acting on even beginning to speak about the proof that will eventually end murder and cancer and death … that it's something like stopping us from building a &amp;quot;loving caring house&amp;quot; rather than one that … fills it's halls with bug spray instead of air conditioning.&amp;nbsp; I'm beside myself, and very sure that in almost no time at all we'll all agree that the idea of &amp;quot;simulating&amp;quot; these things that we detest–natural disasters and negative artifacts of biological life … that it's inane and completely backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=”text-align: center;”&gt;&lt;a href=”./ATITEN.html
“&gt;&lt;img alt=”” src=”./i.imgur.com/Up3vvKi.jpg” /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand there's trepidation, and you're worried that girls won't like my smile or won't think I'm funny enough… but I have firm belief in this message, in words like &amp;quot;precarious&amp;quot; that reads something like &amp;quot;before Icarus things were … precarious&amp;quot; but more importantly my heart's reading of those words is to see that this has happened before and we are more than prepared to do it well.&amp;nbsp; I want nothing more than to see the Heavens help us make this transition better than one they went through, and hope beyond hope that we will thoroughly enjoy building a &amp;quot;better world&amp;quot; using tools that I know will make it simpler and faster to accomplish than we can even begin to imagine today.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, I read more into the myths of Norse mythology and its connections to the Abrahamic religions; it appears to me that much of this message comes to us from the &lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotunn">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotunn</a>”&gt;Jotunn&lt;/a&gt; (who I connect (in name and …) to the Jinn of Islam, who it appears to me actually wrote the Koran) and in those stories I read that they believe their very existence is &amp;quot;depenedency linked&amp;quot; to the raising of the sunken city of Atlantis.&amp;nbsp; Even in the words depth and dependency you can see some hidden meaning, and what that implies to me is that we might actually be in a true time simulator (or perhaps &amp;quot;exits to reality&amp;quot; are conditional on waypoints like Atlantis); and that it's possible that they and God and Heaven are all actually all born … here … in this place.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these might appear like fantastic ideas, you too can see that there's ample reference to them tucked away in mythology and in our dreams of utopia and the tools that bring it home … that I'm a little surprised that I can almost hear you thinking &amp;quot;the &lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://thehub7xbw4dc5r2.onion.to/index.php?topic=20927.200">http://thehub7xbw4dc5r2.onion.to/index.php?topic=20927.200</a>”&gt;hub&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=”./SALTLINE.html”&gt;ris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of this guy, who does he think he is…. suggesting that 'the &lt;a href=”./WISDATAM.html”&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt; to change everything' would be a significant improvement on the ending of the Serendipity Prayer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really see that it's far more than &amp;quot;just disease and pain&amp;quot; … what we are looking at in this darkness is really nothing short of the hidden slavery of our entire species, something hiding normal logical thought and using it to alter behavior&amp;nbsp;… throughout history … the disclosure of the existence of a hidden technology that is in itself being used to stall or halt … our very freedom from being achieved.&amp;nbsp; This is a gigantic deal, and I'm without any real understanding of what can be behind the complete lack of (cough …&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gofundme.com/the-sword-of-saint-one">http://www.gofundme.com/the-sword-of-saint-one</a>”&gt;financial&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://flowcrypt.com/me/adam">http://flowcrypt.com/me/adam</a>”&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt;) assistance in helping us to forge ahead &amp;quot;blocking the chain.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; I really am, it's not because of the Emperor's New Clothes… is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=”./ACESHI.html”&gt;&lt;img src=”./i.imgur.com/CKr7dva.jpg” width=400&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth mentioning once again that I believe the stories of Apollo 13 and the LHC sort of explain how we've perhaps solved here problems more important than &amp;quot;being stuck on a single planet in a single star system&amp;quot; and bluntly told that the stories I've heard for the last few years about building a &amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; between dark matter and here … have literally come true while we've lived.&amp;nbsp; I suppose it adds something to the programmer/IRC hub admin &amp;quot;metaphor&amp;quot; to see that most likely we're in a significantly better position than we could have dreamed.&amp;nbsp; I've briefly written about this before … my current beliefs put us somewhere within the Stargate SG-1 &amp;quot;dial home device/DHD&amp;quot; network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… &lt;strong style=”font-size: 29px;”&gt;rumspringer&lt;/strong&gt;, then? … to help us &amp;quot;&lt;a href=”./ACESHI.html”&gt;os&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=”center”&gt;&lt;a href=”./HAMMER.html
“&gt;&lt;img src=”./i.imgur.com/Nh9YFXT.jpg” alt=”DANCING ON THE GROUND, KISSING… ALL THE TIME” width=”400” height=”272” /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=”justify”&gt;Maybe closer to home, we can see all the
“flat Earth” fanatics on Facebook (and I hear they’re
actually trying to “open people’s eyes” in the bars.. these
days) we might see how this little cult is really exactly
that–it’s a veritable honey pot of “how religion can dull
the senses and the eyes” and we still probably fail to see
very clearly that’s exactly it’s purpose–to show us that
religion too is something that is evidence of this very same
outside control–proof of the darkness, and that this
particular “cult” is there to make that very clear.&amp;nbsp;
Connecting these dots shows us just how it is that we might
be convinced beyond doubt that we’re right and that the
ilence makes sense, or that we simply can’t acknowledge the
truth–and all be wrong, literally how it is that everyone
can be wrong about something so important, and so
vital.&amp;nbsp; It seems to me that the only real reason anyone
with power or intelligence would willingly go along with
this is to … to force this place into reality–that’s part
of the story–the idea that we might do a “press and release
in Taylor” (that’s PRINT) where people maybe thought it was
“in the progenitor Universe” – but taking a step back and
actually thinking, this technology that could be eliminating
mental illness and depression and addiction and sadness and
… that this thing is something that’s not at all possible
to actually exist in reality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=”center”&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img src=”<a class="reference external" href="http://en.numista.com/catalogue/photos/etats-unis/g1587.jpg">http://en.numista.com/catalogue/photos/etats-unis/g1587.jpg</a>” alt=”Image result for buffalo nickel” width=”99” height=”98” /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might think that means it would grant us freedom to be
“printed” and I might have thought that exact same
thing–though it’s clear that what is here “not a riot”
might actually become a riot there, and that closer to the
inevitable is the historical microcosm of dark ages that
would probably come of it–decades or centuries or thousands
of years of the Zeitgeist being so anti-“I know kung fu”
that you’d fail to see that what we have here is a way to
top murders before they happen, and to heal the minds of
those people without torture or forcing them to play games
all day or even without cryogenic freezing, as Minority
Report suggested might be “more humane” than cards.&amp;nbsp;
Most likely we’d wind up in a place that shunned things like
“engineering happiness” and fail to see just how dangerous
the precipice we stand on really is.&amp;nbsp; I joke often
about a boy in his basement making a kiss-box; but the truth
is we could wind up in a world where Hamas has their own
virtual world where they’ve taken control of Jerusalem and
we could be in a place where Jeffrey Dammer has his own
little world–and without some kind of “know everything how”
we’d be sitting back in “ignorance is bliss” and just
imagining that nobody would ever want to kidnap anyone or
exploit children or go on may-lay killing sprees … even
though we have plenty of evidence that these things are most
assuredly happening here, and again–we’re not using the
available tools we have to fix those problems.&amp;nbsp; Point
in fact, we’re coming up with things like the “&lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project</a>”&gt;Stargate project&lt;/a&gt;” to inject useful information into military
operations … “the locations of bunkers” … rather than
eeing with clarity that the Stargate television show is
exactly this thing–information being injected from the
Heavens to help us move past this idea that “hiding the
means” doesn’t corrupt the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;meta charset=”utf-8” /&gt;
&lt;div align=”center”&gt;&lt;a href=”./2017-08-10-tiny-chellos-in-sky-are-playing-angry.html
“&gt;&lt;img src=”./i.imgur.com/4sRcWbS.png” alt=”EARTH.” width=”400” height=”302” border=”0” /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without knowledge and understanding of this technology, it’s
very possible we’d be running around like chickens with our
heads cut off; in the place where that’s the most dangerous
thing that could happen–the place where we can’t ensure
there’s safety and we can’t ensure there’s help … and most
of all we’d be doing it at a time when all we knew of these
technologies was heinous usage; with no idea the wonders and
the goodness that this thing that is most assuredly not a
gun or a sword … but a tool; no idea the great things that
we could be doing instead of hiding that we just don’t
care.&amp;nbsp; &lt;img src=”blob:http://imgur.com/a6e3463c-6c37-4a4d-8c8e-8cf964c828fc” /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We’re being scared here for a reason, it’s not just to see “&lt;i&gt;Salem&lt;/i&gt;”
in Jerusalem and “sale price” being attached to air and
water; it’s to see that we’re going to be in a very
important position, we already are–really–and that we need
knowledge and patience and training and … well, we need a
desire to do the right thing; lest all will fall.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
o, you want to go to reality… but you think you’ll get
there without seeing “round” in “ground” and … caring that
there’s tens of thousands of people that are sure that we
live on flat Earth … or that there’s ghosts haunting good
people, and your societal response is to pretend you don’t
know anything about ghosts, and to let the pharmacy
prescribe harm … effectively completing the sacrifice of
the Temple of Doom; I assume because you want to go to a
place where you too will be able to torment the young with
“baby arcade” or …&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;i suppose there are those&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;in the garden east of eden&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;who’ll follow the rose&lt;br /&gt;
ignoring&lt;/i&gt; the&lt;i&gt; toxicity of our city&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;and touch your nose&lt;br /&gt;
as you continue chasing rabbits&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
if it isn’t immediately obvious, this line appears to be about the realiztion of the Bhagavad-Gita (and the “&lt;a href=”./SERENADE.html”&gt;&lt;/i&gt;pen&lt;i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” of the Original Poster/Gangster right?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=”font-size: 20px;”&gt;… swinging “the war”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=”./SERENADE.html”&gt;&lt;img width=”300” src=”./i.imgur.com/u5CFzf4.png” /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p align=”center”&gt;&lt;span style=”font-size:20px;”&gt;p.s. … &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm 37.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=”center”&gt;&lt;a href=”http://multicomics.net/online/thefoxxx-alien-abduction-of-batbabe/”&gt;&lt;img alt=”” src=”./i.imgur.com/Fp2q3ZV.jpg” style=”width: 250px; height: 126px;” /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=”center”&gt;so … in light of the P.K. Dick solution to all of our problems … it really does give new meaning to Al Pacino's &amp;quot;say &lt;strong&gt;hello&lt;/strong&gt; to my little friend&amp;quot; … &lt;em&gt;amirite&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
