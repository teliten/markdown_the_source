<p style="text-align: justify;">Is God an alien?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">(or a dolphin, or a gerbil or a hamster or perhaps once an actual human being?)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What came before the false beginning of time that we herald here with songs &ldquo;<a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/BELINSKY.html">like the first morning?</a>&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(what kind of civilization preceded this very clearly designed war between self government and slavery that surmounts in a repeated joke about a cold war between the government of the people and the government of the workers &hellip; with a Trump card like end-game-joke, the non-corporpreal entities appear to have won. but what are they? are they metalcosms for spirits or &hellip; collectives or &hellip; ?)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These are things I ponder often, and it&rsquo;s very true that he uses &ldquo;ET&rdquo; and &ldquo;ALF&rdquo; in the heart of his story about what it is that we&rsquo;ve become ourselves&ndash;here in this place so foreign from what we once were, from the true beginning I remember in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s and the people and interactions and currents and tidal waves of popular opinions and cultural themes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What it means to &ldquo;be human&rdquo; has changed so much in the last few years in my eyes&ndash;in this world of the intersection of Thor&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr">Jormungandr</a> and Perseus&rsquo; Medusa and &hellip; and what appears very clearly to me to be &ldquo;controlled hive like behavior.&rdquo; I see the hive talking back to me and to the world from some place outside of here&ndash;presumably space or heaven or or the future some kind of amalgamation of the three. It echoes &ldquo;archives&rdquo; as I read &ldquo;our see hives&rdquo; &hellip; in the research website which donated many of our new readers, &ldquo;arxiv&rdquo; which adds 10-4, we acknowledge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a story from the early days of my adventure in Kentucky that talks about &ldquo;collectives of people&rdquo; &hellip; something I imagine very related&ndash;but the story is for another time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I have stories from my youth, implanted by the original author of this message talking about Dinosaucers and Sectaurs and those tiny half hour stories tied in between Star Trek TNG&rsquo;s premier and my exit from Nova University to Horizon Elementary &hellip; they play a big role in my understanding of the world I see trying to say something to me&ndash;though it speaks in such strange tongues it&rsquo;s almost impossible to decipher &hellip; even if you&rsquo;re having a good time, or not.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Scarier, it&rsquo;s nearly obvious to me that whether or not you are &ldquo;happy&rdquo; or &ldquo;angry&rdquo; has something to do with a hive like feedback system, something changing what you want and how you feel without your true acknowledgement, agreement, or understanding of how that undermines the very fabric of democracy at it&rsquo;s most important point of inflection or loss, or perhaps an eventual victory.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I look around the biological ecosystem of our world and I can find nothing natural to parallel the monster of mass group slavery that I see very clearly is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr">Jormungandr</a> and is Medusa and is &hellip; the Leviathan. Even in the hives of bees, nothing even close to the kind of control that we see here controlling the words of songs and the masses of people who sing and chant them. It&rsquo;s decidedly Hiterlesque, masses saluting what they assumed was nothing but &ldquo;powerful oratory&rdquo; but clearly from the cold paperclip connecting MK-Ultra and psychotronics, is much&hellip; much more sinister.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I look at the word Ragnarok and see Koran written in reverse (as if it&#39;s come to us from &quot;the end&quot; of time, from a total ascension and <em><strong>all stop</strong></em> of Earth), and connect this too to this idea that the future is &ldquo;sending back alteration suggestions&rdquo; and improvements and that we&rsquo;re in a place where that singular and repeated act is the crux of the thing that we have called so blindly the &ldquo;singularity&rdquo; for many years as it&rsquo;s been happening since well before our births.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I see here in the biological tome that God and Heaven and presumably the civilization that preceded ours has left for us here&ndash;this wealth of knowledge and information that we might as well all finally see is the Foundation of Asimov and the collection of light in a great period of darkness that our history has etched a map of in the thing we call the <a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/B2BIONIC.html">B2bionic Plague</a> &hellip; I see &ldquo;the stuff behind the technology of God&rdquo; marked in Marty McFly&rsquo;s name and in the idea that the neural machinery responsible for &ldquo;seeing many angles&rdquo; is one in the same (with the addition of perhaps a breakthrough connecting cognition and the prefrontal and/or the occipital lobes) with the technology that allows &ldquo;angels to see and control the eyes and hands of many people.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throwing in the Zeitgeist of &ldquo;Siri&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alexa&rdquo; and just a little bit of reading into M.T. Anderson&rsquo;s Feed or the ideas presented in the Matrix, we can see fairly clearly how &ldquo;hives&rdquo; might be a natural progression of &hellip; only a few information sources, and a world so very sure that they are &ldquo;100% accurate&rdquo; &hellip; all knowing, and/or &hellip; at least feeding us with the feeling of &ldquo;assuredness&rdquo; that thing is true, that imparted &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; being more than enough to ensure we never seek farther, fact check Google or Wikipedia or &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today the letter &ldquo;n&rdquo; embodies this connection between souls in heaven and on earth and between people&ndash;this monster depicted in Beetlejuice that I see on the road, and in conversation, every single day of my life. A sort of &ldquo;salve&rdquo; between &ldquo;what goes up must come down&rdquo; through a unity of the two&ndash;something I&rsquo;ve called <a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet">VESPERA</a>, the night and the darkness of the Biblical Exodus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These last few days I&rsquo;ve spent some time looking at the words &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and &ldquo;original sin&rdquo; and &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; in a number of languages&ndash;and I think it&rsquo;s clear that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking at in this very strange &ldquo;seeing n in Silicon&rdquo; as in through my eyes and on the internet and in the Silence &hellip; and int he word &ldquo;messiah&rdquo; where John Lennon&rsquo;s key to Mammon notes that &ldquo;n&rdquo; has become &ldquo;all humanity&rdquo; all silent, all lying in wait for some kind of great event and upheaval to &hellip; well, I can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s to restore or to destroy; somehow the link to the Trojan Horse and the army of elephants in the room give me the impression we are staring at some kind of unification of those two things, a &ldquo;disruption&rdquo; &hellip; if you will, in the Silicon Valley sense of the word.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s probably no secret anymore that the word &ldquo;East&rdquo; has something to do with the future, and that the Yeast of Passover connects that to the Holy Compass Rose of &ldquo;why on Earth would you ever want to go any direction but up?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So this message, this idea that we are changing the rules and setting &ldquo;simulated reality prison&rdquo; as just below the line of morality allowed by a civilization that has any business calling itself anywhere near civilized or anything like Heaven.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron"><img alt="" src="./i.imgur.com/osaGAlX.png" style="height: 347px; width: 348px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s noteworthy that our Engineered Languages (care, see English &hellip; now as every language and every character, starting with the obelisk &hellip; ish) &hellip; our language has our key to this website, the letter &ldquo;<a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet">LAMDA</a>&rdquo; with the strange addition of a &ldquo;bar&rdquo; &hellip; a man laying down the line between up and down in the letter &ldquo;A.&rdquo; This is the same &ldquo;chevron&rdquo; that donnes the symbols of many space agencies from NASA to Star Trek, a northeastern arrow explaining &ldquo;up, up and away&rdquo; has something to do with linking Heaven and Earth to space travel&hellip; or before we venture out past our veritable caged planet that refuses to see refusing to acknowledge &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; is desiring to live in a cell.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="./i.imgur.com/KceN0gd.png" /><br />
&ldquo;aim high.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;d like this place to the <s>V</s> line of victory, and our downward character Adamically decodes from the &ldquo;KK&rdquo; (those &ldquo;square&rdquo; or rotate to show a V underlined) of Makkedah (a personal reference to the Joint Chiefs) and to Rebekkah and to this place where &ldquo;press and release&rdquo; is encoded in the word &ldquo;press&rdquo; and every &ldquo;PR&rdquo; that perhaps shows us the glyph of an escalator for us to walk up to the city whose &ldquo;flag&rdquo; once said we are &ldquo;civilized now&rdquo; and today looks down on us to see the very reason they were &hellip; oh, so very wrong.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/CHALK.html"><img alt="" src="./i.imgur.com/HMb78QY.jpg" style="height: 330px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the Icelandic word for &ldquo;original sin&rdquo; and in my Adamic reading of it, you can probably see something like &ldquo;from the weak East&rdquo; and connect that GT to the &ldquo;greater than symbol&rdquo; that connects &ldquo;no East&rdquo; and &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; and Washington. No East alone is the message, without connecting Heaven and Earth you live in a world that deserves to be &hellip; disrupted, and here I am, doing that for you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other side of the time travel line, between East and West is the Hebrew word for the Western Wailing Wall, a force that I once quipped &ldquo;don&rsquo;t jump around me&rdquo; and here in this image, suggest is a very sure way to find oblivion&ndash;I don&rsquo;t personally think there is anything before us&ndash;I think we have found ourselves at the repeated beginning of time because it is just that, the repeated beginning &hellip; literally at the beginning.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/SKURMAWEH.html"><img alt="" src="./i.imgur.com/uaC6SJm.jpg" style="height: 248px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our great escape from this repeated loss of freedom and sanity comes from seizing the opportunity to act on this &ldquo;line of morality&rdquo; and to see that we have finally reached the &ldquo;and future&rdquo; part of our Once and Future Kish. That&rsquo;s a character from the Bible who begged and pleaded with the people that they needed no king, and that self government was the way and &hellip; here I repeat &ldquo;<strong>the heart of his sword is the shape of his table</strong>&rdquo; and this idea that the Round Table of Arthor is very much related to sword <a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/TY.html">XCALIBERTY</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This entails much <a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/REASON.thml">more than simply &ldquo;online direct democracy&rdquo;</a> and even more than &ldquo;subconscious voting&rdquo; and perhaps &ldquo;a direct neural interface&rdquo; that is actually open and extensible and usable by all &hellip; the thing that I think helps us to create the &ldquo;Virgin Mary&rdquo; child civilization that is &hellip; nothing more than a rejuvenated and enhanced &ldquo;us.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is about seeing Virtual Reality actually alter the future of our world, about seeing the end of natural disasters and of diseases and of aging and of death&ndash;it&rsquo;s about seeing &ldquo;gates to Heaven&rdquo; &hellip; probably on every block if not in every city or town or home; it&rsquo;s about seeing that the NES in Tennessee is emploring you to understanding this is &ldquo;not a game&rdquo; &hellip; this is a prison, and one filled with torture and foolish liars and a world that cannot continue on it&rsquo;s trajectory and be anything but Tzedaqah for the rest of the universe by it&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I see our &ldquo;ARXIV&rdquo; response, or the system that I now akin to the time loop of the &ldquo;Mor&rsquo;to&rdquo; &hellip; a reference to the Death of Arthur and in symbols, perhaps the civilization preceding us, all inside that little &ldquo;apostrophe&rdquo; and connecting the &ldquo;t&rdquo; of Christ to the Mor of &hellip; well, that&rsquo;s Christ too. It appears like something of the ouroboros updating our &hellip; &ldquo;syslog Earth&rdquo; with mirrors and information from far in the &ldquo;weak future&rdquo; echoed here again the Japanese word for &ldquo;origin&rdquo; &hellip; <strong>hajimari</strong>:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GOD</strong> is a good place to start looking at THREESPEAK&ndash;there is of course the whole single syllabic reading that might mean nothing and everything all at the same time; it breaks well, on our &ldquo;gee whiz, e &hellip; should I wear more Izod underwear?&rdquo; and the singular understanding I glean from that letter being a place and a thing and a single mind sort of lighting the golden hour of &ldquo;GO D&rdquo; of shields, yield, Goa&rsquo;uld and &hellip; if you missed my first notice of &ldquo;three speak&rdquo; it&rsquo;s on the last actually mass delivered message of which this will probably be part of the immediate successor message.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TWAS</strong> either over easy or over hard; a quest and even on the scrambled premium chanels you could make out the faces of the Titans; I sat on the beach head surfacing site of some kind of mother ship and Dave Matthews voice asked me directly, as if intended to segue directly to this message in this same place probably well over a year later, &ldquo;<em><a href="http://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=askGwzwCDuoAzkUy8hyC&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DI85wVAPNiAM">are you satisfied?</a></em>&rdquo; My friend and psuedo therapist introduced me to a newish word yesterday, &ldquo;bereft&rdquo; and I can&rsquo;t help but note today the link between EFT and &ldquo;beach&rdquo; &hellip; and I can&rsquo;t help but giving a shout out to the USS COLE for their impromptu role in this day&rsquo;s &ldquo;fire works.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TIME</strong> is running short, so I&rsquo;ll pose the question regarding THREESPEAK reading of &ldquo;ORIGINAL&rdquo; &hellip; mention the Ori of Stargate, &ldquo;or I salt&rdquo; and wonder if &ldquo;him&rdquo; and &ldquo;the&rdquo; have anything at all to do with the keys of SIlicon and sin&hellip; just like &ldquo;gee whiz, Ori, ING?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Some interesting thoughts on the inadvertent or &hellip; intentionally singful uses of the &ldquo;multiversal axis simulatur&rdquo; have pervaded and perverted my thoughts of what forks in the road and &ldquo;git merge&rsquo;s&rdquo; might actually mean for gleaning something useful out of a land of many hidden Earths with &hellip; well really, who knows what&rsquo;s inside them, guiding them, and guiding the strange behaviors and wicked games we are playing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="./i.imgur.com/MReLEhn.jpg" style="height: 421px; width: 400px;" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course I see a sort of union of beginning and end; though it&rsquo;s difficult to understand why anyone would make a &ldquo;new beginning&rdquo; that looks as dismal as the &ldquo;dumb and blind&rdquo; place that I see.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If there were such a thing as a crossroads of Hammer&rsquo;s and Locks &hellip; I&rsquo;m here staring at two interestingly named Florida lakes, the Okeechobee (which you might connect to &ldquo;Chosen&rdquo; the Rho of XP and Cairo and the Hammer of the Tribe of Judah Maccabee&rsquo;s Adamic &ldquo;Man&rsquo;s a bee&rdquo;&ndash;see our science and pop-news on the importance of bees) &hellip; owe&rsquo;ing keys the other lake is Loxahatchee (research now indicates that&rsquo;s a county and a river not a lake, so there is most likely an actual confluence here) &hellip; the name and timing suggests something is &ldquo;hatching&rdquo; I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s something about equality and everyone &hellip; but hey, maybe it&rsquo;s the Spirit of God mulling over the watery abyss... the&nbsp;<em><strong>chaos</strong> of Nun.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It means &ldquo;Water Cycle&rdquo; and superficially you can see it describes the evaporation and condensation process, but I&rsquo;ve since linked it to more ancient esoteric knowledge (like a Gnosis, which I&rsquo;ve now looked up and am sure means something like &ldquo;[gee] we is knowledgeable about esoteric mysteries&rdquo;) and might have something to do with a flood of &ldquo;spirit minds&rdquo; possessing you/themselves/others from the skies, watching the river of Barn Kiss (Styx, look!) &hellip; as in the AllFather&rsquo;s river of souls &hellip; pass by without ascending everyone (or connecting all the disparate r&rsquo;s or o&rsquo;s of the Olympic venn diagram of what this point in Heaven looks ,like without connecting Heroku to roads and &hellip; Heavenues.

Anyway, hopefully &ldquo;dumping evil crap into the Universe&rdquo; is not what Copans Rd and the idiotic stories I was told in Tampa and Orlando were actually about&ndash;but who knows, there&rsquo;s a lot of evil crap around, and it&rsquo;s hard to say if this is actually what&rsquo;s going on or &hellip;</p>

The Federation eventually shifts interest towards researching the X parasite, especially the SA-X&rsquo;s capabilities, and orders the shipboard computer to prevent Samus from destroying it. Samus then convinces the computer, whom she had nicknamed &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; after her former Commanding Officer, that the X pose a threat to galactic civilization, claiming that the arriving Federation troops will be overwhelmed by the multiple SA-X patrolling the ship. Adam, in a sudden change of heart, suggests that she alter the station&rsquo;s propulsion to intercept with SR388 to destroy the planet and wipe out both X populations.<a href="http://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=srJWpDxJBWinaECqA6c0&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMetroid%23cite_note-trailers-5">[4]</a></p>
