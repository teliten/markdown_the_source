<p style="text-align: justify;">Pine Crest&rsquo;s <em>anthem</em> coming to tune on this Flag Day; June 14; 2020 &hellip; &ldquo;<em>our towers so tall and white</em>&rdquo; &hellip; the turn of phrase that reminds me of the high crest of Thompson&rsquo;s <em>Fear and Loathing</em>, and in the same sort of tidal movement; the low water mark just before &ldquo;Tsunami&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tsadi&rdquo; &hellip; tie of course to this thing that is happening our world&ndash;this very scary thing that I don&rsquo;t think we truly understand. Atlas &hellip; speaks to us; &ldquo;<em>care, is me</em>&rdquo; and so does the Lord of the Lore of Idioms; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a riot&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&rsquo;t like seeing mayhem and riots and looting and racism and police brutality&ndash;almost more than I don&rsquo;t like seeing &ldquo;two party representative democracy&rdquo; trying to deal with &ldquo;it&rdquo; without being &ldquo;the reason it&rdquo; &hellip; <em>or whatever that means</em>. I don&rsquo;t think things like &ldquo;crowned thy good with [don&rsquo;t call me your brother] hoods&rdquo; [and understand, now there&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>not just one of me</em>&rdquo; anymore] &hellip; that thing I said all the time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;<em>purple mountains majesty</em>&rdquo; are there to get you to pick up arms and say &ldquo;molon labe&rdquo; &hellip; to &ldquo;reinstate the emperor&rdquo; &hellip; but here I am pointing out a thing that should be made by an emperor or a populace at large, or even a minority or even &ldquo;all&rdquo; &hellip; this hell is proof that there&rsquo;s something more heinous than fascism&ndash;and you&rsquo;re it. Sorry to say&ndash;this is Arimathea; on the uhhh&hellip; &ldquo;notion that we might all be a little better off dead&rdquo; &hellip; and it really shouldn&rsquo;t be that, or ever have been anything like that.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We should all be sundancing in the winds of the galaxies cheers for the great holy <em><s>name</s></em> we did when we figured out that &ldquo;resh&rdquo; was either &hellip; right or &hellip; &ldquo;an eternal fire of burning hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think those obvious &hellip; very obvious &hellip; references to racism in the history of America are there to help us see and stop things likje slavery, and the rewriting of memories in cities like Nuremburg and Geneva. I think that&rsquo;s a clear part of the story of America and of Exodus and of religion and of humanity, and I think if we don&rsquo;t get that&hellip; or if we think this a game or a &ldquo;stage reenactment&rdquo; you&rsquo;re the missing the point, because I&rsquo;m ready to ZUNI&ndash;<em><a href="http://gate.lamc.la">both you and I</a></em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If this is really you&ndash;if you&rsquo;re heart is in making a play for some meta-freedom or echelon higher computer song and dance about &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay for electrical clock cycles because we feed chickens in the world adam is tortured in&rdquo; then I think &hellip; I mean, ZUNI.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here though it looks like the dawning of a Nunuremberg &hellip; another movement designed and cajoled and &ldquo;crafted by the strange controller beings&rdquo; to erase something from history&ndash;whether it be just some names and places, or slavery itself &hellip; or in the scariests of possibilities what if this thing that is happening &hellip; is happening here, in <a href="%5Bhttps://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/plantation-resident-starts-petition-to-change-citys-name/2247912/%5D(https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/plantation-resident-starts-petition-to-change-citys-name/2247912/)">my birth town of Plantation</a> (I think named after the Motorola Plant the town was built around&mdash;anachronistically&ndash;but hey) and <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-sb-broward-courthouse-statue-to-be-removed-20171010-story.html">Broward too, the county</a> &hellip; I&rsquo;m sure one day they&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;how stupid was he not to know what was going on, being born in the city of Sunrise, Sunrise County&ndash;Galactic District of the Protectorate&rsquo;s Rex.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&rsquo;s my word (<em>just a few today)</em> on the Galactic Confederacy&ndash;in fiction sometimes called &ldquo;the United Federation of Planets&rdquo; &hellip; but really, we know the difference between a treaty organization and an Empire&ndash;we do.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">I dream of a Confederacy that is &hellip; what Geneva and the Hague were supposed to be; I suppose a third &ldquo;League or Nations&rdquo; &hellip; or United Humane Renumberg&ndash;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An alternate history turned bright new future when the money base and the populace &hellip; are the driving force behind a &ldquo;renued&rdquo; freedom and equality that saves us all and our children and everything affected by the beginning of time &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">from the &ldquo;#vongesh&rdquo; &hellip; look up, turn around this painful mess of evil sick and ill green fire&ndash;<br />

<p>Slashdot takes on new meaning to me today; they portend in jest or secret-pig-latin that they are the key to some kind of hidden configuration file or the .git archive database &hellip; of &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; or something, in my mind today just guessing at the name I never understood though thoroughly enjoyed reading Commander Taco&rsquo;s very censored and very well chosen day old news &hellip; every momrning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here I&rsquo;m showing a history of something; it&rsquo;s the Holy Ubuntu&rsquo;s Holy Debian&rsquo;s Holy APT&ndash;&ldquo;a package tool&rdquo;&ndash;I imagine, and that too probably is aptly nothing to do with Peter&rsquo;s gate or with Washington&rsquo;s Osiris. Of course there&rsquo;s a history of better or newer ways to &ldquo;<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage">emerge</a>&rdquo; (this one is special, it does things &ldquo;a little&rdquo; different) or &ldquo;brew&rdquo; up some kind of thing that would &hellip; have kept me from having so many issues with IPFS&rsquo;s orbitdb and so many issues with Textile&rsquo;s &hellip; &ldquo;perfect solution.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There&rsquo;s the original in my mind&ndash;that&rsquo;s the perl library archive called &ldquo;plan&rdquo; &hellip; that;&#39;s a joke&ndash;it&rsquo;s c<a href="https://www.cpan.org/">alled CPAN</a>; and there&rsquo;s a<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">rlso CRAN</a>; the same kind of software repository that lets you build things with little pieces and blocks of smaller code to make something you want out of a bunch of stuff you never knew how to do&ndash;or wanted to learn. It&rsquo;s supposed to make it &ldquo;just work&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;hub&rdquo; pointing out that &hellip; not so jesting &ldquo;Killed&rdquo; and &ldquo;Go&rdquo; have more me in mind than &hellip; whether or not you want to see me show you &ldquo;<em>my Golden Rule.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>All Debian <a href="https://sources.debian.org/">//gypceresfsco/sources.debian/</a> are belong to us <em>&ndash;Anonymous</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m just mentioning <em>OrbitDB</em> here one more time; and correcting the previous error&ndash;I failed ot mention that problem came from yet another multi-package #likejustsnapyourfingersbrowandbuildit here of course #bright and also aptly named &ldquo;the NPM&rdquo; &hellip; which of course connects night and &ldquo;post me&rdquo; to our &ldquo;ridian&rdquo; &hellip; and of course the apt missing &ldquo;me&rdquo; in the time connected acronym you might imagine has nothing or something to do with Slashdot and the Nicean Chancellors and Creed and the &hellip; <em>Tanakh</em> &hellip; <em>Manishtana</em> &hellip; and &quot;what&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/characters/nm0000113">in a name without Sandra Bullock&rsquo;s &hellip; Holy Line</a> &hellip; that of course only makes sense reading backwards in word-time and connecting it to the &ldquo;ex post facto&rdquo; rebirth of Anakin from the Lake of Vader&rsquo;s demise.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway &hellip; long story short &hellip; something like <a href="https://runkit.com/">gcom/runkit</a> &hellip; of course with more &ldquo;dialects&rdquo; and running on a distributed systerm like &quot;a bunch of &ldquo;bikechain&rdquo; IPFS &ldquo;compute&rdquo; nodes &hellip; might be the Holy Grail of like &hellip; &ldquo;cloud computing&rdquo; as in Heavenly rather than the &hellip; significant lack of &hellip; call it &hellip; coherent resource management (or sanity) that we seem to not think things like &ldquo;Docker&rdquo; &hellip; are like &hellip; &ldquo;docking us a few thousand compute hours&rdquo; just for being so damned wasteful. I&rsquo;m looking at stuff like that&ndash;obviously&ndash;and haven&rsquo;t even tried RunKit yet. It just &ldquo;looks&rdquo; like an out of the box, maybe I could get OrbitDB to run &hellip; on that&ndash;of course, if I had &ldquo;buckets&rdquo; or &ldquo;IPFS storage&rdquo; available &hellip; wait a second &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Back to the task at hand; this very humorous commentary on &quot;who is the grease behind the /.block and then hidden &ldquo;blocklayerd&rdquo; of Heaven &hellip; is this very interesting piece on how &ldquo;helping out&rdquo; [even if it&rsquo;s just for a &ldquo;commit record byline&rdquo; or a comment or &hellip;] is a good way to start &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Microsoft is crediting a developer after he accused the company of copying the core mechanics of its new Windows Package Manager. AppGet developer Keivan Beigi provided a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272964/microsoft-winget-windows-package-manager-appget-copied">detailed account of Microsoft reaching out</a> with interest about his package manager, inviting him for interviews, and then ghosting him for months before unveiling its own package manager that he felt was inspired by his work.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Beigi claimed the &ldquo;core mechanics, terminology, the manifest format and structure, even the package repository&rsquo;s folder structure&rdquo; of Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Package Manager (winget) are all heavily inspired by AppGet. Microsoft only briefly mentioned AppGet once in its announcement, in <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-package-manager-preview/">a throwaway line</a> that lists other Windows package managers. A variety of Windows package managers exist, and are used to automate the process of installing and updating apps.<br />
Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t dispute the claims. &ldquo;Our goal is to provide a great product to our customers and community where everyone can contribute and receive recognition,&rdquo; says Andrew Clinick, a program manager responsible for the app model at Microsoft, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/winget-install-learning/">in a blog post</a>. &ldquo;Over the past couple of days we&rsquo;ve listened and learned from our community and clearly we did not live up to this goal. More specifically, we failed to live up to this with Keivan and AppGet. This was the last thing that we wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Clinick stops short of directly apologizing for the circumstances around AppGet and winget, and admits Microsoft&rsquo;s implementation was inspired &mdash; or as he puts it &ldquo;helped us get to a better product direction&rdquo; &mdash; by AppGet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No scripts during install &ndash; something that we completely agreed with and don&rsquo;t allow with MSIX</p>

<p>Rich manifest definition within GitHub &ndash; the power of being open combined with rich declarative meta data about the app is so important to meet goal #1</p>

<p>Support <strong>all</strong> types of Windows applications installers</p>

<p>Seamless updates for applications in the repository</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Microsoft is now promising to credit Beigi in an upcoming update to the readme portion of the Windows Package Manager. We reached out to Beigi to comment on the blog post and Microsoft&rsquo;s overall response, but the developer says he&rsquo;s still in discussions with Microsoft over the issue. &ldquo;There are a few areas Andrew and I have been discussing,&rdquo; <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/353#issuecomment-637016016">says Beigi</a> in a comment on GitHub. &ldquo;Hopefully we&rsquo;ll have something to share with you guys soon.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">and with that &hellip; i <em>bid you mileu</em> also I did not mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum_(software)">yum</a> just because I don&rsquo;t like it &hellip; or &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_Ports">ports</a>&rdquo; just because I&rsquo;m the little FreeBSD devil. Or &ldquo;<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a>&rdquo; just because I love python and &hellip; uhhh &hellip; <em>Magwitchy</em>?</p>
