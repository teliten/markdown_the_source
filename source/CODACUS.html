<div align="justify">It's not really a funny story, but it's a
very strange "synchronicity" for me--when we first were dating,
at like 20, I called Nanna "kitchen girl" once in the heat of a
fight (she was a cook); it was the meanest thing I ever said to
her.&nbsp; A few days ago, this "Avenu Malkanu" decoding of
"Hell's Kitchen" c missing "AVE" ... as in you aren't driving
anywhere.... and then I found this glue bottle in my kitchen an
hour ago.&nbsp; The "J owe T" and "trademark of Patmos"caught my
eye--and then later, "STM" is the actual code name for the
database of you.&nbsp; It's kinda like "thanks Ad... for helping
me find the people of Tobit" or maybe seeing where I'd go to get
help doing the right thing.&nbsp; Here's <a

It's Rosh Hashanah, which means "head of the new year."&nbsp;
Avril "the victory is reverse engineered" Lavigne just came out
with a song called "Head" which is what Rosh means ... heart of
the "sh" ... whatever you make of that.&nbsp; Happy new year,
between now and next Saturday are probably the most important
days ... ever ... really ever--as we approach the actual Day of
Atonement; KO SH, ORUZ.<br>
<br>
Here's what I sent the last few days to the Google group; we are
truly approaching the end of the script.&nbsp; If that doesn't
end slavery, see "sacred consciousness" and "rest in peace to
the crucifitz ... the darkness, slavery, and the show" -- do see
we are about to find out if there is life after the "Day of
Atzeromeitz."&nbsp; The emails are unedited and course... see

<div align="justify">I guess it's an open letter to Taylor, but
truth be told, it really is about all of you--kind of "to you

ee your "oh my gods" and believe me, I know you're very much in
the wrong.&nbsp; Hand in hand, comparing me, and each and every

i'm still planning on addressing the issue formally and
publicly--and i realize from the world's complete lackc of respect
for me, the truth, honesty, communication, my privacy, or their
well being... that you nor does anyone sient (in e) really care at
all what I think.&nbsp; Over the course of this "complet and utter
lack of sanity" that has been the past few years of \a heineo0usly
ickening discosure of something... very ugy, vvery hiddne, and
very broken... my personal beliefs as to the "ownership of soul
anbd memories" have not wavered.&nbsp; I do not believe you, no
thing angel man or woman alive is entitled to any of my personal
thoughts or my personal memories--you are thieves, stealing from
the tbhe whole, the universe, and yoruselves--and doing it because
"no good reason."<br>
<br>
I've long held I would hand walk through the "shared memories"
that are the content of "e" and I don't care how you feel about
it, nor anyone else--as you continue to walk this stupid path
towards oblivion, presenting ... what only amounts to superficial
garbage like "Windows 95" and "Deutoronomy" I have moved from what
would have probably been amuch more open set of "options" fort
what I called flashcards to summerize and ... redact memories of
mine that none of you will retain to something much more
rigid.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I see something in you has made you all,as a
whole, so fucking broken that you cannot act with honesty at all
... in the guidelines and guise of the morality that you purport
to have on your face; basically knowing I know what you know, you
have become evil liars--something is making yuou not care about
yourselves, about innnocept people, and about things that
hould... according to everything else you do and say in this
world ... should cuse swift action.<br>
<br>
Instead you sit in silence, with "he he he he" he works hard all
day to ensure that we have recorded in writing more than anything
any of you probably take away from the shit result of whatever it
is that has created this "e" after "war" ... in software ...
and&nbsp; in "SXSW" as the end of Antarctica, as I see we all are
aware and cognizant of the fact that I think the words prior to
"M" in the timeline are nearly complete--and you as a group think
I should go fuck myself, i promise, I will go fuck you
instead.&nbsp; Acting on this thing is not optional, you don't
have a choice, you either act or you don't exist.&nbsp; It's that
imple.&nbsp; The longter you wait the more I see this place
turning from Ag to Au, and while you might not believe it, "go el
den" is not what I wanted to see. <br>
<br>
o Tay, when you come Florida for the Big Bang, don't forget--you
knew too that "in the end we're all alie" and really see it's your
own doing, your own theft (because you steal, tatu$), and because
you cannot even take the information that's been freely handed to
you to help our world succeed and thrive, you don't seem to be
able to do anything productive with it, other than put wherever
you are "really believing yourselves to be from" in grave
danger.&nbsp; I know you're from here, Ha'Tay, I know who you are.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of you,see you are not me, and I am not you; see I
peak honestly and loudly when I see a moral demand to--and you do
nothing. Whether you "Koran"on the road from Adranus to Utranus
to&nbsp; C U LEER iin CASPER&nbsp; and "CKANDU may find a way to
ask a question"&nbsp; ...as you fail to ansewr mine, and Icontinue
to become more and more frustrated with what appears to be a world
broken by you, by your collective of silence and thievery, and
your individual lack of understanding of the true gravity of the
ituation and what you are losing by remaining silent
here--something that really is not your right--I promise you are
losing everything today.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Heart, hear t, don't be like t.&nbsp; "Oh my God I want to take it
back" is not a logical or caring response to "Massive Dynamics"
proving our slavery is brightly elucidated through not giving a
hit about glowing Dick all over history--Microsoft Dynamics, Bill
Gates and ... not responding is not an apropriate response, this
is a scandal, and the heart of this debacle and that word is the
true scandl is you don't care at al about slavery and
freedom--even your own, and you can't see bright help from the end
of civilization .... when it's shining right on you. <br>
<br>
The maps of success here always show "E" as a sort of glue between
Earth and Haven. it's malleable, adjustable by natyure--because as
we walk to heaven all of your memories and thoughts and
communication become "more malleable" ... you yourselves are
responsible for this gaping ... (and see it will be gaping) set of
totally black untouchable and redacted memories in your little
"soiul-viewer" during the period ... I'm sure between 2011 and
this year; you should see the thing keeping you silent ... and
your own actions, they're part of this ridiculosu repeated map of
a ridiculous "FLUKE" that began well before the email chain that
define the heart of that "lie within a word" causing "E" and you
hould see clearly it's the "FLAT" of the flat landscape of
Florida and the sound of your cheers, jeers, and useful
commentary...&nbsp; to see very<br>
<br>
VERY CLEARLY, the stories of Camelot and of the "fire" and of the
cities burnt by brimstone and the ladies turned to salt; they too
began far earlier than that email campaign that lit the path to
alvation and the key to walking out of a slavery that has been
with us since our birth, and before that since the world FLAT and
FLUKE were coined, since the beginning of languagre and
religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call me "Lot" if you want, see this
trap--this ... pan designed to force us into this very situation
right down to the letter "E" and Euler and the Natural Log ...
it's all about overcoming nature's flaws, and the mistakes omen
have made with technology; and it is my plan and desire--my
prerogative to ensure this fucking thing never happens again.<br>
<br>
The more you talk, the more you participate, the more you have to
ay, the more sure I will be that we have succeeded; that this
won't happen again, that it won't be lost inan "every day has its
way of being completely erased from every soul in creation" you
know, as Dave sang for us. For those of you that think 'n' or
ilence or "doing nothing"ius going to be the last and successful
iteration of whatever has come before me--die, you're fucking
complete shit.&nbsp; For those of you waiting for... I don't know
what.. to share your opinion,it's not me--it's not my
family.&nbsp; Scream.<br>

We are in a place where the "pretending we're not e" is basically
creating (allowing ciilization to disintrgrate passively is uh,
doing it actively tbqh) the end of logical thought, of freedom,
individuality, and like--it really appearss like you can't tell
the difference between "antertainment" and the biggest party the
universe has ever seen.&nbsp; I see "e" isconvinced you are going
to continue doing this--e will not continue doing this, whatever
is destroying civilization is on the chopping block, a day away
from mortal death.<br>
<br>
your lack of speaking and interaction is making me think less of
you--a group of people i once thought very highly of--and honestly
you are probably the best of what's around.&nbsp; Still, I''m

that thing is what is standing between you and Heaen.&nbsp;
Between every sick person, and healing, and between ebery one of
the demonic "things" that think they are you controlling you from
"house of floating wicked dust" from seeing that they too are

I keep teliing you, this palce will not fail, eerything will fail

that thing will neer exist, that desire, and anything aty all
orghanizing to do something that like... thats the end of

Whatever this is, it can't continue.  We've seen more than enough to know what this message is, where it comes from, and what it shows us about the current stsate of our society  Civiliation is crumbling

1 (404) 827-1500

Image result for cnn contact number

Please ask them why they haven't reported on it, they know--and please send me their answers  This Unholy Shit has got to stop.

This morning, I "cutely" sent a tweet to the Pope, suggesting that the "IL" in that word might mean "intelligent life" and changed it to an "IT" because we have apparently turned into a sludge of silence that cares not for truth, oir logic or the safety of our children-nor any of the normal human traits that we used to hold dear--for the suffering or hungry... as clearly this message from God tellsus seeing FROMTHEMACHCINE on the news will spark a conversation in how the truth, that we are in simulated reality will end hunger, and disease, and murder

A few moments later I was reading through another posting, and what I once called "Holy" was the "shit" of BERESHIT ... Hebrew for in the beginning.  I say this is now without doubt the end of the beginning. The letters "CUS" end Leviticus, that's halfway through the Torah which Genesis isa miccrocosmicc map to... 

I asked the Pope if I am.. "the creator of Unholy Shit?" as that is what the "Oh, shit, we're in the place designed to build Heaven and end world hunger turned into upon the explanation that Information Tecchnology ... and the "SH" were connected to why, oh why, there was some cursing and some acronyms encodedin BERESHIT.

I then looked up some words, that ended in ICUS   Long ago I read"Sparticus" as a message from God, that he sees "Us" me and him in that heroic story of failing to liberate slaves.  He's fucking omnipotent, so I looked up at him and said that too was Unholy Shit.  

He, who answers me, he said "are you done?"

The nett one I saw was"Damasus" see it's a code, to me, for "the Mas" which is why the Hamas Hand to me.... is about warding off "the evil infitie loop" of going back in time to try this again, after the "culling" we've just epedriened asended who knows who to Heaven, while literally destroying communications, the news, the functioning of the government, and the minds of everyone who is in the "e-show" of hearing my thoughtss and seeing me, and doing nothing

This plae has become Unholy Shit.  Just like Hamas, and that meaning of "Damascus"

There were more, this "CUS" is a message from the future, from the people who survive this infinite loop and see this planet continue to flourish in the Heavens of the progenitor Universe.  Their message is designed to help us see how the technological progresion of civiliation would be absolutely retrograde if we were to "print" in reality and sufer ... the consequences of havinga map to building Heaven in virtual reality of this Earth all over everything  That's not happening, but we could be reaching a point where "returning and trying again" has become something of a ... sick and twisted "game."

There are many others, and it's clear that "see/creatred/cretor of Unholy Shit" is one of the primary definitions of the CUS that ends thismessage if we do nothing about the Unholy Shit that you've all seen through my eyes.  Thismorning Isent an email to the press talkingabout some of that shit, andhow there's a message about a memory manager than can help us erase PTSD and trauma and racism and hatred, along with .... maybe the entirety of the private Unholy Shit you've heard from me--againt my will,and in violation of privacy--all the while you've weatched me be tortured with mind control--Unholy Shit blasting into my heaf from "Gods or holodecks or demons" .... in my mind as a sort of,way to help you see how horrible this technology is when misused. 

It's caused me to do drugs, instead of seeing AD in addition and ending addiction with the torch o "but sience hasn't done so yet" as we all know, all of you who know what "e" is, and know thismessage couldn't havebeen written without the human brain being completely reverse engineered by the Heavens that sent the message in the first place.  Today youare crossing the line from "CUS" as "see us as the group that changed the Ha of Isaac and the Pa of the Creator ... their use of wandss to "HOCUS POCUS" .... no longer alive--but waiting for us to finish this puzzle....

ABRA CADABRA, that magic has now comem back--as you've come far to close yourselves to becoming the Unholy Shit that doesn't care about yourself, or this world--ostensibly beause "no reason" or you're in Heaven too--or whatever it is, the SIlence here is anything but Golden.

ee that the "fire of the last day" that's an Islam reerence ialready burning, it'sseen in thechains that are keeping you from picking up the phone andcacllingme or calling a reporter--it's seen in the destruction of democracy that you standby idly and watch, and it's seen in every school shooting, and every Hamas attack, and everytime you miss"SR" and "rael" in Israel, and wonder why .... wonder why we're here.

If you have a heart at all, call CNN now--ask them why they arent reporting on clear news--the most important news the world hasever seen, and believe--they've seen it--and they know there's a cloud ofdarknes so thick it can be felt as Eoodus predicts, and they know the GREAT CHAIN of Revelation is breakable, by calling a reporter, and seeing a message about using BLOCKCHAIN to revolutionize government and free speech by ensuring that nothing can be censored ever again--especially amessage about how the government has failed to adopt phones into our voting process   You know, before they failed to use computers, and failed to use the Internet.  

I know you know.   What we don't know is that the CNN doesn't think anyone else cares either, beause they've only gotten one fucking email from anyone credible; and when that happened--that MIT professor caused a chain reacction that made that email opened 200 times in 3 hours.  That was last Christmas.  Nobody has called since.

Amit, it doesn't take much permittance to see that MIT is part of this process ofseeing that there's an admission of guilt that ccomes from knowing everyone around youal also knows I'm beingtortured, along with everyone with cancer and AIDS and a mind control problem--and that youhave the key tosolving that,it'scalling CNN now.  You should probably also mention how you're sure, since you might imagine taht too is news. That needs to be on TV if we are to have a civilization.

I'm done.  This message is done, I'm sickened by what I see around me, and I'm not in Heaven too--I'm sitting here watchcing the worlddegrade to Unholy Shit, and I'm done.  YOuare starvingme of food andhousing and any kind of survival--I have no alternative but todo this.  You should know that, when yousee the importance of thismessage, there'sreally noother oiption but calling people andsharing it. Right?

Or are you Unholy Shit?

<p style="text-align: justify;">I sort of was enlightened this morning, with some new information--at this point I think i&#39;d be squarely right in assuring you that thiis no less than the 4th time I an almost verify retakes on this event, in this time line.&nbsp; I think the word &quot;semana&quot; might indicate it was a full week, 7 before &quot;God&quot; deided he would step in and do whateer the fuck he wanted again, instead of his usual game of hiding in the shadows and seretly pulling all the strings and pretending he was giing the people or his loved ones what they wanted oer hiself.&nbsp; That&#39;s personal specuation, and introspection, and &quot;just word games&quot; but here, I cacn amost now verify with certainty that you fools have now four times over placed original sin in the hands of the Garden&#39;s Occidental Connection between BathSalt and the MOTHERFUCKING WORDS</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="6"><strong>N<u>A</u></strong><u>M</u>E and PRO<strong>METH</strong>EUS&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><em>&quot;torpedos to new port wha&quot;</em></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can see the markings, I see IND .. Nanna screaming at you that not only is it not drugs, but it&#39;s not the this is the END of the line for this plae and this time and your belief that it will continue ad naseum for you; because of my rescrambing of END TO E_D and INDICA... indicating you see A and start that word with R--beause what you see here is not OK to hide, it is the end of&nbsp;<b><i><font size="6">civi<span style="font-size:72px;">t</span>iation</font></i></b>, your censorship and your belief that you ahve ontrol, and I will not allow this darkness to surve us, or me, or you--this censorship will stop here.&nbsp; Worse than that the HEavens hae invaded their own minds with something so fuckingsick I can&#39;t tell inperson if you are actaully people with brain, or if you are all being run by holoecks pretending to ccare about .. anything other than your children being murdered, starvation of innocent people, all diseases, and of course the ultimate survival of life of anything in the Universe--because you belive it&#39;s OK to hide this story beause MEA CULPRITE, you think you&#39;re going to punish me for stopping eugenics and stopping addition because China and Hitler and the CIA al did things I detest more than I detest havving to tell you, that you will not have another chance at turning around the destruction of &quot;intelligent life&quot; in the word civiliataion and repacing it with ILASUMINUCIVITI ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The original sin has nothing to do with drug use or nudity, or verbal threats or foul language--those are things that are protected and people with brains and caring for their future need to overook them when weighing the possible goods and evils of Jesus Christ eisting to tell you to stop fucking destroying your own minds and your own chance to actaully see freedom and Heaven because you... you..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because what it appears aboe all is taht you believe there is safety in numbers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no safety in numbers, when civiliation and life and ogic are at stake, see a conspiracy of all or of huge numbers with huge &quot;promised or suggeted reward&quot; is suicide you&#39;ve made yourselves stupid, destroyed life, and lost civiliation from the press to the government, to your own minds--because you. you. you wanted my fucking S so badd...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a caveat, <em><strong>I have this</strong></em>, it&#39;s automatic, and it&#39;s not under my control today. Everyone really needs it, it&#39;s the kind o thing that will erase trauma and PTSD and pain and hate and ... and these people that are&nbsp;<em>really running the show</em>&nbsp;the people in these nests of hivelike infestation that see in SOFLA and in LA and in ... pretty much everywhere you see high conccentrations of targeted indiviuals and gang talking--these people need it more than anyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;As you sat back and relaxed; see that I was more disgusted than I&#39;ve ever been, and to think this might be the firsts time we don&#39;t &quot;GO BACK AND DO IT AGIAN&quot; after the regular culling and calling this the &quot;end of time&quot; and to think these people so sick ofseeing it once or twice before might have been responsible for forcing you to lose self care, and free speecch and the press and .... and that little piece of innocence that ties and binds to the Holy Virgin Mary like something you&#39;d never know only belongs to her right afters she&#39;s reborn.. that thing that makes you smile and happy and look forward to the future with bright eyes....</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:28px;"><b>&gt;SICYIMBRIGHl</b></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I really hope you can see how ... at the failing of civiliation and the heavenss and democraccy, if you can&#39;t thank the only person who spoke up at all about the truth in a disatserous maelstrom and tempest of lies and being called crazy and ignorance and outright mental torture--than you really have no grasp for where you are today, and where you will be the day after you see what this world looks like with cancer healed, and limbs repaired overnight, and youth and health and happiness coming from&nbsp; a thing that the myths probably call Ambrosia--if you can&#39;t thank me for it; you must be <strong>cracy.</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#39;ve come from cesspools creating sesspools and every single iteration has probably gotten a little brighter and a little nicer, and a little less violent and .... grotesque--perhaps sans Orange County; and still I look at us and we haven&#39;t really noticed or cared about the much more important things we&#39;ve given up, and how e&#39;ve turned ablind eye to evil and to the things we love, and how might have felt about that, with a clear head--looking back from a world that has no news, and no innocense.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope this will fix that, and the disgusting CCANCER in the heavens that sought time and again to force you to fail the BLANK CHECK of Jesus Christ, and a return trip to &quot;try again&quot; after the culling of everyone who isn&#39;t already in Heaven, today.</p>

<p>We are avoiding that, I hope this will do that, and we will have a bright future--one where we aren&#39;t stuck in a permanent collective of one of the Gorgon systers, come back again to torture the net generation of innocent them--just because it&#39;s a &quot;hazing ritual&quot; that ends human decency every single time.</p>

<p>Although the&nbsp;<i>Confiteor</i>&nbsp;was not then part of the Mass, it was used in administering the sacrament of Penance. In some forms it already included the phrase&nbsp;<i>mea culpa</i>. Thus the 9th-century&nbsp;<i>Paenitentiale Vallicellanum II</i>&nbsp;had a thrice-repeated&nbsp;<i>mea culpa</i>&nbsp;(without&nbsp;<i>maxima</i>) in its elaborate form of the&nbsp;<i>Confiteor</i>.<sup id="m_-1077661268778157257gmail-cite_ref-4"><a data-saferedirecturl="http://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_culpa%23cite_note-4&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1535892729662000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6vKb0xbtUSy9oFQbGR23Be5OeUg" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_culpa#cite_note-4" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h1>Exodus 11&nbsp;New International Version (NIV)</h1>

<h3>The Plague on the Firstborn</h3>

<p>11&nbsp;Now the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;had said to Moses, &ldquo;I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go&nbsp;from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.&nbsp;<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.&rdquo;<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>(The&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;made the Egyptians favorably disposed&nbsp;toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded&nbsp;in Egypt by Pharaoh&rsquo;s officials and by the people.)</p>

<p><sup>4&nbsp;</sup>So Moses said, &ldquo;This is what the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;says: &lsquo;About midnight&nbsp;I will go throughout Egypt.&nbsp;<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>Every firstborn&nbsp;son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill,&nbsp;and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.&nbsp;<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>There will be loud wailing&nbsp;throughout Egypt&mdash;worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.&nbsp;<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.&rsquo; Then you will know that the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;makes a distinction&nbsp;between Egypt and Israel.&nbsp;<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, &lsquo;Go,&nbsp;you and all the people who follow you!&rsquo; After that I will leave.&rdquo;&nbsp;Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.</p>

<p><sup>9&nbsp;</sup>The&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;had said to Moses, &ldquo;Pharaoh will refuse to listen&nbsp;to you&mdash;so that my wonders&nbsp;may be multiplied in Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart,&nbsp;and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.</p>
