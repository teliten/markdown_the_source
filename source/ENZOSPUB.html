It&rsquo;s hard to tell whether the inhabitants within these tiny flecks of nearly dust are sane or pained, even aware of the vast and distant sea shore merely hinted at in the stories etched forever into the shards.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A spirit divided, a <a href="./TOASTRAM.html">splitting headache</a> and parting words no more clear or less direct than &ldquo;you were warned.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not hard to make the comparison between the Biblical story of the Judgement of Solomon and the God Forseti; but it takes knowing this story very personally to really understand how much sick sarcasm is laced into the mythology below&ndash;the words &ldquo;justice and reconciliation&rdquo; piercing with ice cold memories of actually seeing the spirit of the Child Christ cut in half in Kentucky&ndash;of understanding it&rsquo;s a sick and twisted mockery of the same kind of story in the Bible&ndash;about seeing &ldquo;cut the baby in half&rdquo; as a matter of love or death. But here, this place&ndash;this sick monster that believes it has co-opted and now controls Creation believes it can, and it did do exactly that not more than 4 years ago. It&rsquo;s dead, that&rsquo;s not a story, that&rsquo;s the word, that&rsquo;s &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; &hellip; that&rsquo;s it. Just like &ldquo;Solderini&rdquo; and a personal story about a shoulder &hellip; and a word that reads &ldquo;see how owe you dark to right&rdquo; compares just one to one with &ldquo;split.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Annoying, &ldquo;word games&rdquo; not much more than absolute proof of total control and of the undeniable creation of all language and civilization by a single mind&ndash;being ignored en masse by this sick &ldquo;E&rdquo; garbage, not to see the language it certainly is fluent in gives a pearl of wisdom, that split, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it&rdquo;&ndash;too.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a03.htm#16">1 Kings 3:16&ndash;28</a> recounts that two mothers living in the same house, each the mother of an infant son, came to Solomon. One of the babies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlaying" title="Overlaying">had been smothered</a>, and each claimed the remaining boy as her own. Calling for a sword, Solomon declared his judgment: the baby would be cut in two, each woman to receive half. One mother did not contest the ruling, declaring that if she could not have the baby then neither of them could, but the other begged Solomon, &ldquo;Give the baby to her, just don&rsquo;t kill him!&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The king declared the second woman the true mother, as a mother would even give up her baby if that was necessary to save its life. This judgment became known throughout all of Israel and was considered an example of profound wisdom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In juxtaposition, you idiots actually believe you can and should 1) kill your Creator, 2) split him in half so you can two house-slaves and 3) go outside and put a leash on the most powerful entity that has ever existed&ndash;so you can &hellip; make it kill you slower, I guess.</p>
