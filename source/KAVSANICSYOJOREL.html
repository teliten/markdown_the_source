## The U.S. Constitution, as you [mighta been, shoulda "come" ... its someday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Ol1Rd9ABI) rewr***ϕ***te it.
Politicians talk about the Constitution as if it were as sacrosanct as the Ten Commandments. But the document itself invites change and revision. What if the president served only one six-year term instead two four-year terms? What if your state's population determined how many senators represent it? What if the Constitution included a right to health care? We  [asked](http://hive.slate.com/hive/how-can-we-fix-constitution) legal scholars and  **_Slate_** readers to cross out what they didn't like in the Constitution and pencil in their hearts’ desires. Here's what the document would look like with their best ideas.

### To a question on the idiom; is Bablyon about "the law" or "of [the lan]()d of [Nod]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8bTdBs-cw))?"

"What is democracy" ... the song, Metallica's "ONE" echoes and repeats; as we apparently scrive together the word "THEM" .... I question myself ... if Babylon were the capital city of some mythical Nation of Time ... if it were the central "turning point" of Sheol; 

Can you not see that in this place; in a world that should see *and does* there is a gigantic message proving that we are not in reality and trying to show us how and why that's the best news since ... ever---that it's as simple as conjoining "the law of the land" with a basic set of rules that automatically turn Hell into something so much closer to Heaven I just do not understand---why we cant stand up together and say "bullets will not kill innocent children" and "snowflakes will not start avalanches ...." that cover or bury or hide [the road from Earth to Verita](./MEVATHI.html)l)e .... or fr[om the mythical Valis to Tanis](./ORTANIS.html)---or from [Rigel](./RIGELA.html) to Beth-El ... "*guess?*"

 It's as simple as night and day; Heaven and Hell ... the difference between survival and--what we are presented with here; it's "doing this."  It's ending the ELE of "representative democracy" and "electoral college" and giant screaming grande message about "extinction level event" .... is literally just as simple as "not caring" or thinking we are at the beginning of some long process--or thinking it will never be done--that special "IT" that's the e[m]()a[ncipation of you and I.](./GATE.html)

... but recently suggested an old joke about "there being 10 kinds of people in the world (obv an anti-tautology and a tautology simultaneously)" only after that brief bit of singularity and duality mentioning the rest of the joke: "those that understand binary and those that don't know how to base convert between counting with two hands and counting with only an 'on and off.'"  It's not obvious if you aren't trying to figure it out, I suppose; but 10 is decimal notation for "kiss" and the "often" without "of" ... and binary notation for the decimal equivalent of "2."  A long long time ago in a state that simply non-randomly ties to the heart of the name of our galaxy ... I was again thinking of the "perfect imperfections" of things like saying "three equals one equals one" (which, of course was [related to the Holy Trinity](./LANDOH.html) and it's "prescient/anachronistic Adamic presence encoded in the name [Ab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_(Semitic))|[ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra)|[ha](./he_laughs.html)|[m](http://archive.is/wip/ok9vk)" which means "father of a great multitude") ... I brought that one back in the last few months; connecting the letter K and in this "logos-rythmic" tie to the "base of a number system" embellish the truth just a bit and suggest a more accurate rendition of the original [there is no such thing as equality, "is" of separate objects--as in no two snowflakes are the same unless they are literally the same one; true of ancient weights and with the advent of (thinking about) time no two "planets" are the same even if they're the exact same one--unless it's at a fixed moment in time.
 > * This name may be viewed either as **meaning** "father of many" in Hebrew or else as a contraction of ABRAM (1) and הָמוֹן (hamon) **meaning** "many, multitude". The biblical patriarch **Abraham** was originally named Abram but God changed his name (see Genesis 17:5).

### K=3:11 ... to a handle on the music, the DHD of the gate and the *ring of David's "sling" ... 

---and that's a relationship of "3 is to 11" as [the SAT style "analog]((http://archive.is/YWUnw)y" as a series of alpha, two mathematic, and two numeric symbols ... may only tie in my mind alone to the books of Genesis and Matthew and the phrase "chapter and verse" and to the stories of Lot and Job ... again in Genesis and the eponymous "Book of Job." So ... "tying up loose ends [one](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tie_up_loose_ends) [10b]((https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tie%20up%20loose%20ends)) [[III]](http://archive.is/rAxXE) [iv.]() " as it appears I've taken it upon myself to call a Job and suggest is my "[Lot in life](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080917195150AAr1zdO) [[x](https://www.google.com/search?q=lots+in+life&rlz=1CAEAQE_enUS891&sxsrf=ALeKk00F7Cj8VE7EU0ucKLlg_aGtyShG8g:1590341696199&ei=QLDKXo_FC4G2gge3-KXICQ&start=10&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwiP5f2-hM3pAhUBm-AKHTd8CZkQ8tMDegQIDRAt&biw=1517&bih=750)]i* [[3](http://archive.is/wip/cZhNW)]"

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides), _**Iphigenia in Aulis**_  or  _**Iphigenia at Aulis**_[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Aulis#cite_note-1)  ([Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"):  Ἰφιγένεια ἐν Αὐλίδι,  _Iphigeneia en Aulidi_; variously translated, including the Latin  _Iphigenia in Aulide_) is the last of the extant works by the playwright  [Euripides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides "Euripides"). Written between 408, after  _[Orestes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orestes_(play) "Orestes (play)")_, and 406 BC, the year of Euripides' death, the play was first produced the following year[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Aulis#cite_note-2)  in a trilogy with  _[The Bacchae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bacchae "The Bacchae")_  and  _[Alcmaeon in Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcmaeon_in_Corinth "Alcmaeon in Corinth")_  by his son or nephew, Euripides the Younger,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Aulis#cite_note-3)  and won first place at the  [City Dionysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysia "Dionysia")  in Athens.

- The play revolves around  [Agamemnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agamemnon "Agamemnon"), the leader of the Greek coalition before and during the  [Trojan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War "Trojan War"), and his decision to sacrifice his daughter,  [Iphigenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia "Iphigenia"), to appease the goddess  [Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis "Artemis")  and allow his troops to set sail to preserve their honour in battle against  [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy "Troy"). The conflict between Agamemnon and  [Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles "Achilles")  over the fate of the young woman presages a similar conflict between the two at the beginning of the  _[Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad "Iliad")_. In his depiction of the experiences of the main characters, Euripides frequently uses  [tragic irony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragic_irony "Tragic irony")  for dramatic effect.

J.K. Rowling spurred just this past week a series of explanations about just exactly what is a blockchain coin worth ... and why is it so; her final words on the subject (artistic liberty taken, obviously not the last she'll say of this magic moment) "I don't think I trust this."

> Taken directly from an off the cuff email to ARXM titled: "Slow the S is ... our Hypothes.is"
>
>I imagine I'll be adding some wiki/ipfs stuff to it--and try to keep it compatible; the design and layout is almost exactly what I was dreaming about seeing--as a "first rough draft product." _Lo, and behold_. It's been added to the many places I host my  _tome;_ the small compilation of nearly every important email that has gone out ... all the way back to the days of the strange looking Margarita glass ... that now very much resembles the "Cantonese character 'le'" which I've come to associate with a "handle" on multiple corners of a room--something like an automatic coat rack conveyor belt connecting different versions of "what's in the box." I'm planning on using that symbol 了 to denote something like multiple forks of the same page. Obviously I'm thinking forward to things like "the Transhumaist Chain Party" (BDSM, right?)'s version of some particular piece of legislation, let's say everything starts with the sprawling "bulbing" of "**Amendment M**" ideas and specific verbiage ... and then we'll of course need some kind of new git/subversion/cvs style version control mechanism to merge intelligently into something that might actually .... really should ... make it into that place in history--the first constitutional amendment ratified by a "_Continental Congress of All People_" ... but you could also see it as an ongoing sort of forking of something like the "wikipedia page" on what some specific term, say "technocracy" means, and how two parties might propagandize and change the meaning of such thing; to suit the more intelligent and wise times we now live in. For instance, we might once have had a "democracy" and a "democractic" party that had some Anarchist Cook Book version of the history of it ending in something like Snipes and Stallone's "DEMOLITION MAN." 
>
> Just kidding, we all know "democracy" has everything to do with "d is cl ... and not th" ... _**to be the them  that is the heart of the start of the first true democracy.**_ At least the first one I've ever seen, in my old "to a republic" ... style. As it is you can play around with commenting and highlighting and annotating all the stuff I've written and begged and begged for comments on--while I work on layering the backend to to perma-store our ideas and comments on both a blockchain (probably a new one; now that i've worked a little with ethereum) with maybe some key-merkle-tree-walk-search stuff etched into the original Rinkeby ... and then of course distributed data in the "public owned and operated" IPFS. To be clear, I plan on rewriting the backend storage so that we will have a permanent record of all comments; all versions of whatever is being commented on; and changes/revisions to those documents--sort of turning the web into a massive instant "place of collaboration, discussion, and co-authoring" ... if you use the wonderful LEGO pieces that have been handed to us in ideas from places like me, lemma--dissenter, and of course [hypothes.is](https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Qi7d1Mp5EZA5klTMELI1&ret=http%3A%2F%2Fhypothes.is%2F) who has brought you and i such a polished and nice to look at "first draft" of something like the living Constitution come repository of all human knowledge. I do sort of secretly wich they would have called this project something like "annotating and reflecting (or real or ...) knowledge" just so the movement could have been called **ARK**. ... or something .... but whatever join the "[calling you a reporter](https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Qi7d1Mp5EZA5klTMELI1&ret=https%3A%2F%2Fhypothes.is%2Fgroups%2FqQmr2M9v%2Fcalling-you-a-reporter)" group or ...

NOIR INgR .. I **CITE SITE** OF ENUDRICAM; a rekindling of the dream of a city appearing high above in the sky, now with a boldly emblazened smiling rainbow and upsidown river ... specifically the antithesis of "angel falls," there's a lagoon too--actually a chain of several ponds underneith the floating rock ... and in some versions of this waking dream there are rings around the thing; you might imagine an artificial set of centripetal orbitals something like a fusion of the ring Eslyeum and the "Six-Axis ride" of the JKF Center's "Spacecamp."  I write as I dream, and though I cannot for certain explain exactly how; it's become a strong part of my mythology that this spectacular rendition of "what ends the silence" has something to do with the magical delivery of "a book" ... something not of this Earth but an unnatural thing; one I've dreamt of creating many times.  This book is something like the DSM-IV and something like a Merck diagnostic manual; but rather than the old antiquated cures of "the Norse Medgard" this spectacle nearly "itsimportant" autoprints itself and lands on something like every doorpost; what it is is a list of reasons why "simply curing all disease" with no explanation and no conversation would be a travesty of morality--how it would render us half-blind to the myriad of new solutions that can come from truly understanding why "ITIS" to me has become a kind of magical marker: an "it is special" as in, it's cure could possibly solve a number of other problems.

Somewhere between the outdoor rafting ride and the level with the special "[ballroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tHPsphg9xc) of [the ancient gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErsGS3RQNLI)" ... perhaps now being named or renamed or recalled as something about "Face [of] the Music" lies a magical "mini-maize" ... a look at a mock-up (or #isitit) of Merlink and Harthor's "round table" that displays a series of ... (at least to me) magical appearing holographic displays and controls that my dreams have stolen from Phillip K. Dick's Minority Report and something of what I hope Microsoft's Dynamics/Hololens/Surface will become---a series of short "focus groups" .... to guage and discuss the information in the "CITIES-D5AM-MERCK" ... how to end world hunger and nearly all disease with the press of [a magical buzzer](http://nane.lamc.la)--castling churches to something like "po[litical](http://mar.s.lamc.la)-party-[town](http://mars.reallyhim.com)-hall-meeting centers" and replacing jails and prisons and hospitals with something like the "Hospitalier's PRIDE and DOJOY's I practiced "Kung-fun-dance" ... a fusion of something like a hotel and a school that probably looks very much like a university with classrooms and dorms and dining hall's all fit into a single building.  I imagine a series of 2 or 3 "room changes" as in you walk from the one where you get the book and talk about it ... to the one where you talk about "what everyone else said about it" and maybe another one that actually connects you to other people with something like Facebook's Portal; the point of the whole thing to really quickly "rubber stamp" the need for an end to "bars in the sky" nonalcoholic connotation--as in "overcoming the phrase the sky is the limit" and showing us the need for a beacon of glowing hope fulfilled--probably actually the vision of a holographic marker turning into actual rings around the single moon of Earth, the focus of the song annoucing the dawn of the age of Aquarius---

It might lead us also to Ceres; and another set of artificial rings, or to Monoceros and a rehystorical understanding of the birthplace and birthing of the "river roads" that bridge the "space gaps" in the galaxy from our "one giant leap for mankind" linking the Apollo moon landing to the mythological connection to the sun; and connecting how the astrological charts of the ancients might detail a special kind of overlapping--the link between Earth's SOL and something like Proxima or Alpha Centauri; and how that "monostar bridge" might overlap to Orion and from there through Sagitarius and the center of the Milky Way ... all the way to Andromeda and more dreams of being in a place where there's a map to a tri-galactic system in the constellation Cancer and a similar one in Leo ... and just incase you haven't noticed it--a special marker here, I thought to myself it might be cool to "make an acronymic tie to Monoceros" and without even thinking auto-wrote Orion (which was the obvious constellation next to Monoceros, in the charts) and then to Sagitarrius; which is the obvious ... heart of our astrological center and link to "other galaxies."

----I've [dreamt or *scriven* or reguessed numerous times how the Milky Way's map to an "Atlas marked through time by the ages and the ancients" might tie](./DEVLANEU.html) this place and this actual map to the creation of the railways between stars to the beginning and the end of time and of course to this message that links it all to time travel.  There's a few "guesses" I've contemplated; that perhaps the Milky Way chart is a metal-cosmic or microcosmic map to the dawn of time in the galactic vision of ... just after the big bang; or it might tie to a map of something like the unthinkable--a civilization that became so powerful it was able to reverse the entropy of "cosmic expansion" and reverse the thing Asimov wrote of in "[The Last Question](./DEVLANEU.html)" as the end of life and the ability to survive basically due to "heat loss."

In 2018, the city's estimated population was 73,964. Flagstaff's combined metropolitan area has an estimated population of 139,097.

Flagstaff lies near the southwestern edge of the  [Colorado Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Plateau "Colorado Plateau")  and within the  [San Francisco volcanic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_volcanic_field "San Francisco volcanic field"), along the western side of the largest contiguous  [ponderosa pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_ponderosa "Pinus ponderosa")  forest in the continental United States. The city sits at around 7,000 feet (2,100 m) and is next to  [Mount Elden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden "Mount Elden"), just south of the  [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks "San Francisco Peaks"), the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona.  [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak "Humphreys Peak"), the highest point in Arizona at 12,633 feet (3,851 m), is about 10 miles (16 km) north of Flagstaff in  [Kachina Peaks Wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachina_Peaks_Wilderness "Kachina Peaks Wilderness"). The geology of the Flagstaff area includes exposed rock from the  [Mesozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic "Mesozoic")  and  [Paleozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic "Paleozoic")  eras, with  [Moenkopi Formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moenkopi_Formation "Moenkopi Formation")  red sandstone having once been quarried in the city; many of the historic downtown buildings were constructed with it. The  [Rio de Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Flag "Rio de Flag")  river runs through the city.

Originally settled by the  [pre-Columbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian "Pre-Columbian")  native  [Sinagua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinagua "Sinagua")  people, the area of Flagstaff has fertile land from volcanic ash after eruptions in the 11th century. It was first settled as the present-day city in 1876. Local businessmen lobbied for  [Route 66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66 "U.S. Route 66")  to pass through the city, which it did, turning the local industry from lumber to tourism and developing downtown Flagstaff. In 1930,  [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto "Pluto")  was discovered from Flagstaff.

### _pps:_ a magnanimous decision ...

I stand here on the brink of what appears to be total destruction; at least of everything I had hoped and dreamed for ... for the last decade in my life which appears literally to span thousands of years if not more in the eyes of some other beholder.  I spent several months in Kentucky telling a story of a post apocalyptic and post-cataclysmic delusion; some world where I was walking around in a "fake plane" something like a holodeck built and constructed around me as I "took a walk around the world" to ... it did anything but ease my troubled mind.

Recently a few weeks in Las Vegas, and a similar story; telling as I walked penniless down the streets filled with casino's and anachronistic taxi-cabs ... some kind of vision of the entirety of the heavens or the Earth or the "choir of angels" I think of when I echo the words Elohim and Aesir from mythology ... there with me in one small city in superposition; seeing what was a very well put together and interesting story about a "star port" Nirvane ... a place that could build cities into the face of mountains and half working monorails appearing in the sky---literally right before my eyes.

I suppose this is the place "post cataclysm" though I still have trouble understanding what it is that's actually about ... in my mind it connects to the words "we are losing habeas" echo'ed from the streets of Los Angeles in a more clear and more military voice than usual--as I walked block by block trying to evade a series of events that would eventually somehow connect all the way to the "outskirts of Orlando, Florida" in a place called Alhambra.  

Apparently the name of a castle; though I wasn't aware of that until much later.

It doesn't feel at all like a "cataclysm" to me; I see no great rift--only a world filled with silent liars, people who collectively believe themselves to have stolen something--something gigantic--at least that's the best interpretation of the throws and impetus behind the thing that I and mythology together call Jormungandr.  With an eye for "mythological connections" you could clearly see that name of the Great Serpent of Revelation connects to something like the Unseelie; the faeries of Gaelic lore.   To me though this world seems still somewhat fluid, it's my entire life--moving from Plantation to a place where the whole of it might be Bethlehem and to "clear my throat" it's not hard to see here how that land of "coughs" connects to the Biblical land of Nod and to the "Adamically sieved" Snifleheim ... from just a little twist on the ancient Norse land most probably as close to Hel as anyone ever gets--or so I dream and hope---still today.  It all looks so real and so fake at the same time; planned for thousands of generations, the culmination of some grand masterpiece story that certainly ties history and myth and reality into a twisted heap of "one big nothing, one big nothing at all."

I've tried to convey to the world how important I believe this place and this time to be--not by some choice of my own ... but through an understanding of the import of our history and the impact of having it be so obviously tuned and geared towards this specific time ... many thousands of years literally all focused on a single moment, on one day or one hour or even just a few years where all of that gets thrown down on the table as if some trump card has been played--and whether or not you fathom the same magnanimous statement or situation or position ... to me, I think it depends on whether or not you grew up in the same kind of way, believing our history to be so fixed and so difficult to change.  I don't particularly feel like that's the "zeitgeist" of today; I feel like the children believe it to be some kind of game, and that it is such as easy thing to "sed" away or switch and turn into something else--another story, another purpose ... anyone's personal fantasy land come true.  

I don't think that's the case at all, it's clearly a personal nightmare; and it's clearly one we've seen time and time again--though not myself--the Jesus Christ that is the same yesterday, today; and once again perhaps echoing "no tomorrow" never remembers or believes that we've "seen it all before" or that we've ever really gotten the point; the thing you present to me as "factual reality" is a sickness, it disgusts me; and I'd do anything to go back to the world "where I was so young, and so innocent" and so filled with starry-eyed hope that we were at the foot of something grand and amazing that would become an empire turned republic of the heavens; filling the stars ... with the kind of love for kindness and fairness that I once associated very strongly with the thing I still believe to be the American Spirit.

----

"Suddenly it changes, violently it changes" ... another song echoes through the ages--like the "words of the prophets dancing ((as light)) through the air" ... and I no longer even have a glimmer of hope that the thing I called the American People still exist; I feel we've been replaced by some broken container of minds, that the sky itself has become corrupt to the point that there's no hope of turning around this thing that I once believed with all my heart and all my mind was so obviously a "designed downward spiral" one that was---again--so obviously something of a joke, intended to be easy to bounce off a false bottom and springboard beyond "escape velocity" and beyond the dark waters of "nearest habitable star systems (being so very far away)" into a place where new words and new ideas would "soar" and "take flight."

Here though; I am filled with a kind of lonely sadness ... staring at what appears to be the same mistake(s) happening over and over again; something I've come to call "skipping stones in the pond of reality" and really do liken it to this thing that appears to be the new meaning of "days" and ... a civilization that spends absolutely no love or lust to enter a once sacred and holy place and tarnish it with their sick beliefs and their disgusting desires.  You all ... you appear to be some kind of springboard to "bunt" forth yet another age or era of nothingness into the space between this planet and "none worth reaching" and thank God, out of grasp.  Today, I'd condemn the entirety of this world simply for it's lack of "oathkeepers" and understanding of what the once hallowed words of Hippocrates meant to ... to the people charged and dharmically required to heal rather than harm.

It appears the place and time that was once ... at least destined to be the beginning of Heaven ... has become a "recurring stump" of some future unplanned and tarnished by many previous failed efforts and attempts to overcome this same "lack of conversation or care" for what it meant to be "humane" in a world where that was clearly set high aloft and above "humanity" in the place where they--where we were the best nature had to offer, the sanest, the kindest; the shining last best hope.

---

Today I write almost every day ... secretly thanking "my God" for the disappearance of my tears and the still small but bright hope that "Tearran" will one day connect the Boston Tea Party and the idea that "render to Caesar" and Robin of Loxley ... all have something to do with a re-ordering of society and the worth and import of "money" ... to a place that cares more for freedom from murder than it does ... "freedom from having to allow others to hear me speak."  I hold back tears and emotions; not by conscious choice or ability but ... still with that strange kind of lucky awkward smile; and secretly not so far below the surface it's the hope of "a swift death" that ... that really scares me more than the automatons and mechanical responses I see in the faces of many drivers as they pass me on the street--the imagery of connecting it to the serpentine monster of the movie Beetlejuice ... something I just "assume" the world understands and ... doesn't seem to fear (either); as if Churchill had gotten it all wrong and backwards--the only thing you have to fear, is the loss of fear of "loss."

----

Here my crossroads---halfway between the city my son lives in and the city my parents live in--it's on making a decision on whether I should continue at all, or personally work on some kind of software project I've been writing about, or whether I should focus on writing about a "revolution" in government and society that clearly is ... "somewhat underway."  In my mind it's obvious these things are all connected; that the software and the governance and the care of whether or not "Babylon" is remembered as a city of great laws and great change or a city of demons and depravity ... that these thi]ngs all hinge and congeal around a change in your hearts; hoping you will chose to be the beginning of a renaissance of "society and civilization" rather than the kings and queens of a sick virtual anarchy ... believing yourselves to have stolen "a throne of God" rather than to literally be the devastating and demoralizing depreciation of "lords and fiefdoms" to something more closely resembled by the time of the Four Horsemen depicted in Highlander.

These words intended to be a "forward" to yet another compliment of a ((nother installment of a partial)) chain of emails; whimsically once half-joking ... I called it the Great Chain of Revelation.   The software too; part of the great chain, this "idea" that the blockchain revolution will eventually create a distributed and equal governance structure, and a rekindling of monetary value focused on "free and open collaboration" rather than "survival of the most unfit"--something society and civilization seem to have turned the "call of life" from and to ... literally just in the last few years as we were so very close to ... reaching beyond the Heaven(s).

I don't think its hard to imagine how a "new set of ground rules" could significantly change the "face of a place" -- make it something shiny and new or even on the other side of the coin, decayed or depraved.  It's not hard to connect the kind of change I'm hoping for with "collision protection" and "automatic laws" to the (perhaps new, perhaps ... ancient) Norse creation story of the brothers of Odin: Vili and Ve.  

It might be hard to see today how a new "kind of spiritual interaction" might be only a few "mouse clicks" away though--how it could change everything literally in a flash of overnight sensation ... or how it might take something like a literal flash of stardom (or ... on the other hand, something like totalitarian or authoritarian "iron fisting") to make a change like this "ubiquitious" or ... something like the (imagined in my mind as ... messianic) "ED" of storming through the cosmos or the heavens and turning something that might appear to be "free and perfect feeling" today into a universe "civlized overnight" and then ...

I wonder how long it would take to laud a change like that; for it to be something of a voluntary "reunderstanding" of a process ... to change the meaning of every word or every thought that connects to the process of "civilization" to recognize that something so great and so powerful has happened as to literally change the meaning of the word, to turn a process of civilization into something that had a ... "[signta-lamcla☮](http://sign.lamc.la)" of forboding and then a magical staff struck into the heart of a sea and then ... and then the word itself literally changes to introduce a new "mid term" or "halfway point" in which a great singularity or enlightenment or change in perspective or understanding sort of acknowledges ... 

that some "clear outside" force not only intervened on the behalf of the future and the people of our world but that it was uniquely involved in the whole of--

^Like the previous notation; the below text comes from an email previously sent; and while i stand behind things like my sanity, my words; and my continued and faithful attempt to speak and convey both a useful and helpful truth to the world---sometimes just a single day can make all the difference in the world.  

Sometimes it's just a single moment; a flash or a comment about [[^@email](mailto:][^"t](mailto:root@contactaac.com)he blink of an eye" ... and I've literally just "thought up/had/experienced/transitioned thru" that exact moment.

## I ... TERON; 

Gjall are painting me into a corner here; and I don't see around it anymore--I don't see the light, and I don't see the point.  I was a happy-go-lucky little kid in my mind; that's not "what I wanted to be" or what I wanted to present, it's who I was.  I saw "Ashkenazi" and ... *know* I am one of those ... and I kind of understood that something horrible might have happened, or might happen here--and I kind of understand that crying smashing feeling of "**to ash**" that echoes through the ages in the potpourri songs about pockets full of Parker Posey .. and ancient Psalms about "from the ashes of Edom" we have come--and from that you can see the cyclical sickness of this ... place so sure it's "East of Eden" and yet gung-ho on barrelling down the same old path towards ash and towards Edom and towards ... more of Dave's "ashes to ashes dust to dust" and his "smoke clouds roll and symphony of death..." and few words of solace in a song called Recently that I imagine was fleeting and has recently come and gone--people stare, I can't ignore the sick I see.  

I can't ignore his "... and tomorrow back to being friends" and all but wonder who among us doesn't realize it's "ash" and "gone" and "no memory of today" that's the night between now and ... a "tomorrow with friends" not just for me--but for all of you--for this place that snickers and pantomimes some kind of ... anything but "I'm not done yet" and "there's more ... vendetta ... and retribution to be had, Adam ... please come back in a few more of our faux-days."  This is sickness; and happy-go-lucky Himodaveroshalayim really doesn't do much but complain about that word, the "sickle" and the tragic unavoidable ... ash of it all ... these days--you'd think we could "pull out" of this mess, turn another way; smile another day, but it seems there's only one way to get to that avenu in the mind of ... "he who must not know or be me."

I have to admit I found some joy in the epiphany that the hidden city of Zion and it's fusion with the Namayim' version of how that "Ha" gels and jives with the name Abraham and the Manna from Heaven and the bath salt and the tina and the "am in e" of amphetamine--maybe a glimmer or a shimmer or a glow of hope at the moment "Nazion" clicked ... and I said ... "no, not me ... I'm nothing like a king, no dreams of authoritarianism at all in the heart of Kish@r;" even as I wrote words that in the spirit of the moment were something of a "tis of a'we" that connected to my country and the first sing-songy "tisME" that I linked to trying to talk in the rhyming spirit of some "first Christ" that probably just like me was one limmerick away from the end of the rainbow and one "Four Non Blondes" song away from tying "or whatever that means" and this land crowned with "brotherhood" (to some personal "of the Bell, and of the bell towers so tall and Crestian") to just one Hopp skip and jump away from the heart of the obvious echoes of a bridge between haiku and Heroku...  a few more gears shift into place, a click and and a mechanical turn of the face of the clock's ku-ku striking ... it was the word "Earthene" that was the last "Jesusism" around the post Cimmerian time linking Dionysus and Seuss to that same "su-s" that's belonging to a moment in the city of Uranus--codified and etched in stone as "MCO"--not just for its saucer and warp nacelles and "deflector dish" but for it's underground caverns and it's above ground "Space Mountain" and that great golf ball in the heart of it all.  

The gears of time and the dawns of civilizequey.org query the missing "here" in our true understanding of what "in the beginning, to hear; to here ... to rue the loss of the Maize from Monoceros to the VEGA system and the tri-galactic origin of ... "some imaginary universal ... Earthene pax" to have dropped the ball and lost it all somewhere between "Avenu Malkaynu" and melaleuca trees--or Yggrasil and Snifleheim--or simply to miss the point and "rue brickell" because of bricks rather than having any kind of love or nostalgia linking to a once cobblestone roadway to the city in the Emerald skies paved in golden "do not return" signs ... to have lost Avenues well after not realizing it was "Heaven'es that were long gone far before I stepped foot on this road once called too Holy for sandals" in a place where that Promised Land and this place of "K'nanites" just loses it's grip on reality when it comes to mentioning the possibility that the original source and story of Ca'anan was literally designed to rid the world of ... "bad nanites" and the mentality of ... vindictiveness that I see behind every smirk.  

The final hundred nanoseconds on our clock towards doom and gloom cause another bird to fly; another snake to curl up and listen again to the songs designed to charm it into oblivion; whether that's about a club in South Beach or a place not so far from our new "here..." all remains to be seen in my innocent eyes wondering what it truly is that stands between what you are ... and finding "forgiveness not needed--innocent child writes to the mass" ... and the long arm of the minute hand and the short finger of the hour for one brief moment reconcile and move towards "midnight" together; and it's simply idyllic, the Nazarene corner between nil and null you've relegated the history of Terran poast futures into ... "foreves mas" or so they (or you) think.       

----

I'm still so far from "Five Finger Death Punch" though; and so far from Rammstein and so far from any kind of sick events that could stand between me and "the eternal" and change my still "casual alternative rock" loving heart to something more ***death metal***; I rue whatever lies between me and there being any kind of Heaven that thinks there could exist a "righteous side" of Hell and it... simultaneously.  

---

I still see light here in admonishing the masses and the angels standing against the story and the message God brings us in our history.  I still see sparks in siding with the "**causticness**" of "no holodecks in sight" and the hunger and the pain of simulating ... "the hells of reality" over the story of decades or centuries of silence refusing to see "holography" and "simulated" in the word Holocaust and the horrors of this place that simply doesn't seem to fathom or understand the moments of hunger pangs and the fear of "dark Earth pits" or towers of "it's not Nintendo-DS" linking the Man in the High Castle to an Iron Mask.  

I rally against being what I clearly am raised high on some pedestal by some force beyond my comprehension and probably beyond that of the "perfect storm in time" that refuses to itself acknowledge what it means to gaze at such an unfathomable loss of innocence at the cost of a "happy and serene future" or even at the glimmer of the Never-Never-Land I'd hoped we would all cherish and love and share ... the games and the newfound freedom that comes not just from "seeing Holodeck" turn into "no bullets" and "no cages" but into a world that grows and flourishes into something that's so far beyond my capability to understand that I'm stuck here; dumbfounded; staring at you refusing to stop car accidents and school shootings ... because "pedestal."  For the "fire and the glory" of some night you refuse to see is this one--this place where morality rekindles from ... from what appears tobe one small candle, but truly--if it's not in your heart, and it's not coming from some great force of goodness--fear today and a world of "forever what else may come."

Here in a place the Bible calls Penuel at the crossing of a River Jordan ... the Angel of the Lord notes the parallels in time and space between the Potomac and the Rhine--stories of superposition and cities and nation-states that are nothing more than a history of a history of things like the Monoceros "arroz" linking not just to the constellation Orion but to Sagittarius and to Cupid and of course to the Hunter you know so well--

The current state of American representative democracy is the highest standard to which I am currently knowledgable of "extant*"--and it is specifically substandard, inferior, and "just not good enough" as a comparison to the process required to vote in the organization being "self-defined" through *this process*.  It is my sincere and clear hope that "this process" will result in a legal and moral amendment to the document shown in the previous link and [presented by the Legislative Branch of the United States here](https://constitution.congress.gov/).  It is my current and faithful belief that anything else would also be significantly below the standards morally required by "this process" which of course includes over 200 years of American citizenship and (other international relations; [i.e.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teller_Amendment), [e.g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad), [for "iv" example](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment), [id]((https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAEAQE_enUS891&sxsrf=ALeKk02ChqDQSMdrjLAjSwrgREECQ3lgtg%3A1590429386442&ei=ygbMXr28GrGk_Qa17bCQCg&q=%22heart+and+sol%22+%2Bsite%3Afromthemachine.org&oq=%22heart+and+sol%22+%2Bsite%3Afromthemachine.org&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECAAQR1DueljeigFgw40BaABwAXgAgAGWAYgBuQOSAQMwLjOYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwi9yfmUy8_pAhUxUt8KHbU2DKIQ4dUDCAw&uact=5)) [est](./his_heart_and_sol.html), [exemplia gratia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase)) as well as the Sons of Liberty and prior to that contributions from the Crown and the "Parliament and Crown" of the United Kingdom; among others [et alea's ifndef: 'swikipedia/et_al.]([https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/et_alios#English#adamic#orofonlymenunlessthereisnophysicalpossibilityofreducingthatsegregationorseparationfromequality](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/et_alios#English#adamic#orofonlymenunlessthereisnophysicalpossibilityofreducingthatsegregationorseparationfromequality)).

#### alas, babylon.

i listened to a man yesterday who was talking about "true heroes" ... he of course noted jesus christ and superman together, suggesting the first was one, and the second just a fiction. he also talked about people like ghandi and "leaders who use non-violent means to "change the world." i at least agree with him on the third, ghandi is a good prototype for some kind of hero. staring at this ... "to be completed" work on tales of two cities, whether from sodom and gomorrah all the way to athens and sparta and perhaps even london and paris--and this particular city, babylon; it stands out as one which truly has no equal or even "mirror" in the history of the world. i suppose i'd add "alexandria" and suggest the library and the laws; something that are fundamental to the ethos of the planet i call "athens."

i imagine he did not know "hammurabi's" name; and even today in this place where i ask and do not receive answers; i imagine you still don't connect muhammad or amsterdam ... to this king who in our history is set apart and lifted high on a pedestal of having "codified and written down" laws ... for the very first time. it's almost comical, it took me a paragraph and a sentence to connect "the king and i" to this mirror world, where the bible and the people have most assuredly decided "babylon" is a negative thing or a depraved place.

## "fallen, fallen, is [the city of] babylon the great"

... just a quote from one of my favorite movies; which of course is re-quoting "dante" and/or "the bible"

"a dwelling place [of] (the) demons (say), it has become."
