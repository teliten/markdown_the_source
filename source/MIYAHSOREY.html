Your money is worthless&ndash;the way you use it is &hellip; &ldquo;incentivized cannibalism,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s made the world a sick place, and the other side of the coin has left us nothing but &ldquo;fascism&rdquo; and failing economies to parallel&ndash;exactly seeing that here too. Your protests and your methods of protesting are barbaric; as is the massive disregard for the &ldquo;meaning of snifleheim&rdquo; and the &ldquo;spirit of Korantine.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Bethlahem; &ldquo;house, clearing my throat&rdquo; &hellip; the coughing was less telling, and perhaps more suggestive of some kind of double speak (like hurry up, God!) than the current absolute nothing but sickness that speaks to me with fake colds and fake riots and fake &ldquo;reasons we think we should be proud.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t be proud here, don&rsquo;t be proud of your there&ndash;and look at here, and see <em>the writing on the wall</em>. Reading &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t <em>know</em>&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a relatively well used, important and well known phrase&ndash;commonly called an idiom&ndash;that does a decent job of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/04/the-atlantic-politics-policy-daily-the-writing-on-the-wall/557297/">darkness to rapturing</a>&rdquo; the true &ldquo;zeitgeist of the day.&rdquo; It says &hellip; echoes loudly, we &ldquo;see what Jesus Christ is writing about&rdquo; &hellip; and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s us&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;</p>

This now after the previously well railed against destruction of the Fourth in relation to the NSA, the Patriot Act and several cases dictating that the people have no right to knowledge or recourse against the government or AT&amp;T&ndash;for blatant and obvious &ldquo;to the letter&rdquo; disregard for that amendment.</p>

My personal perspective &hellip; whether or are knowledgable of it or agree &hellip; is that this is some kind of very un-grand designed, scripted and &hellip; evil spectacle&ndash;to whit, this <em><strong>looks like Skyfall</strong></em>, not just &ldquo;David, Adam, Moses and Nashon admonishing the sea of &hellip; ignorance.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m still sitting here; on the &ldquo;<em>foot of the bed</em>&rdquo; in the very room where (for remembrance of the day; I&rsquo;m going to call <em>this other) Adam</em> (Azrael [ther: Thurisaz and Azithromycin)) confirmed or at least responded verbally (in the mirror, to the mirror; seemingly in response to the request of the mirror/me) that &ldquo;it speaks&rdquo; &hellip; talking not in undertones or any kind of obscurity about the thing I call &ldquo;<em>planck space stuff</em>&rdquo; (P.S.S.) in relation to some kind of gamey looking process that I&rsquo;ve noted really &hellip; happening only around <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aae_RHRptRg">Clearwate</a>r</em> and <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/omen-peak">Pho</a>e<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbBbFH9fAg">nix</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&rsquo;ve reached past the firmament here; just yesterday&ndash;for the first time in many years with &ldquo;living passengers&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s a sort of monument to the very strange time&ndash;and very strange experience of seeing &ldquo;Mono&rdquo; and the previously very loudly noted &ldquo;apparent decade old time travel research&rdquo; into the strange &ldquo;Koran-tine&rdquo; pandemic of the day&ndash;the &ldquo;Corona virus.&rdquo; It came fairly quickly over the course of only a few months and seems to have forever changed the face of the America &hellip; I&rsquo;ve continued to write seems to stray farther and farther from the &ldquo;thing and people I loved so much.&rdquo; At the very same time&ndash;this exact period&ndash;I&rsquo;ve noticed Monoceros and connected it to a significant message similar to the &ldquo;Atlas&rdquo; of Earth which through time has just noted &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aae_RHRptRg">looking out my back door</a>&rdquo; as I listened to Credence Clearwater Revival&ndash;and minutes ago tried to &ldquo;make clear&rdquo; the tie between the single bridge depicted on a map of what could be the very first &hellip; &ldquo;road between two stars&rdquo; in a constellation just west of Orion (galactically, and with no imagination in the same temporal schpiel of <em><strong>&quot;<a href="./FRUMLEGT.html">frumlegt an</a>&quot;</strong></em> &hellip; the Masonic and Judeochristian connection between Easter and Yeast &hellip; and the land of the rising red sun)&ndash;which only through some kind of (not really a) stretch of mythology would instantly tie to Jerusalem &hellip; were it&rsquo;s &ldquo;true pronounciation&rdquo; ever really spoken or understood outside the context of &ldquo;Gilgam<strong>esh</strong>&rdquo; &hellip; to Cupid and Eros and &ldquo;the arrows of <em>&#39;the hunter you know so well</em>&rsquo; (Europe, <em>Time has Come</em>).&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="summary-act-3-scene-6" style="text-align: center;">Summary: Act 3, scene 6</h3>

<p>Gloucester, Kent, Lear, and the Fool take shelter in a small building (perhaps a shed or farmhouse) on Gloucester&rsquo;s property. Gloucester leaves to find provisions for the king. Lear, whose mind is wandering ever more widely, holds a mock trial of his wicked daughters, with Edgar, Kent, and the Fool presiding. Both Edgar and the Fool speak like madmen, and the trial is an exercise in hallucination and eccentricity.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&quot; i think <em>this</em> is it &quot; (or)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">How: I wrote a rather lengthy email to the dev@hyothesis list last night&ndash;suggesting several options and ideas that I think will &ldquo;bring it a long way.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve personally went through a sort of tiny-epiphany looking for a name for this thing I want to make before I found this particular piece of the puzzle&ndash;which is something like the spider&rsquo;s web slinging gloves. I settled somewhere around the Scandinavian city of &ldquo;Stranda&rdquo;&ndash;as something like the strands between &ldquo;the web&rdquo; &hellip; a significant part of the &ldquo;plan i see&rdquo; is to create a new &ldquo;ontological connection,&rdquo; something more than the &ldquo;anchors&rdquo; which are the thing right now that says &ldquo;this page is also related to &hellip;&rdquo; and of course we have very little in the way of functional &ldquo;backlinks&rdquo; ever since the days of (caring) that was once something Google &ldquo;surfaced&rdquo; and also to mention Tumblr. The idea of course is that people would comment on some page, and it would link to a number of other pages&ndash;and there would be some automatic algorithm to connect &hellip; page to page and &ldquo;heat map&rdquo; the comments and related comments and web of comments that we see sort of being born and stillborn very slowly on sites like reddit. The social &ldquo;relinking&rdquo; and &ldquo;reclaffiying&rdquo; of the connections between things and their import &hellip; probably something we&rsquo;ll one day find useful.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course in keeping with my earlier pushes into &ldquo;what this thing is&rdquo; &hellip; I&rsquo;d like to Hypothesis storing their data in a system that is based on IPFS and blockchain and distriubuted in a way that here makes it &ldquo;immutable&rdquo; and maybe between here the many theres makes it something that connects not just &ldquo;our few web sites&rdquo; to maybe &ldquo;the few internets.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://archive.is/IzAis"><img alt="" src="./i.imgur.com/vatdlB7.png" style="height: 279px; width: 400px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;d like to see this thing incorporate cryptogrpahic identity and cryptographic multi-sig&ndash;I&rsquo;d even like to see something like &quot;the voice of the [insert whatever but&hellip;] &ldquo;Transhumanist&rdquo; (as an example) Party&ndash;literally something like a &ldquo;artificial intelligence seiving&rdquo; of what a group of people are saying or linking or whatever. Mentioning briefly that it&rsquo;s not just anchored hypertext links and comments with those&ndash;but also pictures that are shared and &ldquo;the things the pictures are of&rdquo; and if you see my &ldquo;style&rdquo; here for the last few years&ndash;I&rsquo;m also looking for some kind of &ldquo;Constellation Search&rdquo; that would hypothetically combine something like Amazon&rsquo;s X-Ray and &hellip; in my world tie the many movies I topically and logically link to gether in a single image to something like a &ldquo;these things are connected&rdquo; that also would statistically leave not just a finrgerprint, but perhaps a pointer finger something like my &ldquo;Jacob&rsquo;s Landing Walkway&rdquo; &hellip; a linked list with &ldquo;choose your own next step&rdquo; kind of &hellip; narrowing down and zeroing in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I mentioned in that email, which appears to now be blackholed&ndash;by Google&rsquo;s asanine SPAM filter (not any human intervention) something like &hellip; just seeing this thing and reddit fused&ndash;seeing a place where the many comments are aggregated and the &ldquo;hot stuff&rdquo; is brought to the attention of people that are into that kind of bleeding edge &hellip; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the web talking about&rdquo; and that might get away from &ldquo;Twitter&rsquo;s waves of &hellip;&rdquo; you know, what&rsquo;s Donald talking about, and what did uhh &hellip; Danielle Bregoli have to say about the riots&ndash;or turning 17.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a /great interface/ &hellip; and it&rsquo;s almost exactly what I envisioned&ndash;and it&rsquo;s very similar to the thing Dissenter made &hellip; you know &hellip; &ldquo;in my image&rdquo; and &quot;after my breath was wasted trying to entertain the fact that you might actually financially or with your words or with your programming acumen &hellip; or even maybe with your ability to magically incant the last version of this thing into something more than just &ldquo;a puzzle from the last broken restarts broken image&rdquo; &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I see this thing as &ldquo;complete&rdquo; &hellip; with the addition of course of something like &ldquo;Wikipedia for every page&rdquo; &hellip; an immutable backup of the version of the thing you&rsquo;re talking about; and the ability to actually modify what it says&ndash;or to make these annotations somehow appear &hellip; in &ldquo;five dimensions&rdquo; &hellip; a versioning system for &hellip; &ldquo;forking another piece of electronic paper&rdquo; and adding in your own best ideas. Also on the chain, and also on the IPFS; and also on the &hellip; just while I&rsquo;m typing; adding in &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; about things like the leglsilative process my complete turns to a Beta and now I want to add &ldquo;Github Workflow&rdquo; and some stuff from Six Sigma and from the Business Process Outsourcing industry that I worked in&ndash;you know, from it&rsquo;s very first days.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think we&rsquo;re here&ndash;just a few more words; and I want to see AOC write a bill that has suggested executive implementations&ndash;or guides built within them; and by that I mean I want to see options, we could do this with &ldquo;a website to aggregate the already horribly managed insurance industry we currently have&rdquo; or we could do this with a &ldquo;Red Shield&rdquo; that Christianically ties something like the BC/BS (that&rsquo;s Blue Cross Demolition Shield) and an Insurer of Last Resort &hellip; a government owned insurance company that would of course lowers costs and set a baseline and almost instantly bring us to the actuarial truth&ndash;Universal Healthcare saves lives&ndash;and money.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to see legislation that has a &ldquo;bare minimum&rdquo; and a &ldquo;default implementation&rdquo; as in &hellip; if you can&rsquo;t pass or you can&rsquo;t complete it some other way&ndash;we know we can turn off diseases&ndash;and we know we can erase bullets&ndash;and if you can&rsquo;t stop pretending you don&rsquo;t &hellip; I think you&rsquo;re going to see Adam Marshall Dobrin walk on water in this place to stop you from allowing hell to be created&hellip; ostensibly and absolutely with your name on it and your signature. Each and every one of you has signed this place&ndash;with silence.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="I stand here, writing to you still--for free, paying all of the money I have to ALERT you to the foolishness and the insanity that you are.  I stand here broken, on the verge of death--because not a single of you ... not in the last 2 years could find it in your heart to donate a single dollar to give me enough money to have a roof over my head while I did this.  All the words--all the acts--all of this message was written by a man required to live in a broken and disgusting land that doesn't have Section 8 or the willingness to give a legally and technically diswabled person enough money to &quot;rent an apartment for more than 2 weeks a month.&quot;  You've done this." src="./i.imgur.com/HuD8Koi.png" style="height: 411px; width: 500px;" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I of course want this thing to be software guided and wetware implemented&ndash;and I want to see &hellip; I want you to see how quickly it changes the world. I dream of a day in Kentucky &hellip; when every city&rsquo;s law change overnight&ndash;something like a subconscious to &ldquo;written in Babylonian stone&rdquo; &hellip; you all voted; in the city in the round-table-net &hellip; and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;remember the day the jails disappeared&rdquo; and so the frost on the street and so did the homeless and so d<a href="./CURSOR.html">id the dogs freezing in Denver.</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to write this as succinctly as possible; obviously there are multiple entry points to this thing that is the literal &hellip; &ldquo;Sons of Liberty&rdquo; bright SOL in the sky&ndash;tying to this virus and this moment and this place and &hellip; a hidden unspoken &ldquo;diatab&rdquo; connecting the flag of the European Union and the origin 13 colonies and the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;blue lagoon.&rdquo;</p>
